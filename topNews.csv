"Ark's Cathie Wood Predicts Bitcoin Could Hit $500,000, Says Correction Is Good for ETF Approval",https://u.today/arks-cathie-wood-predicts-bitcoin-could-hit-500000-says-correction-is-good-for-etf-approval,19-05,"In a recent interview with Bloomberg's Carol Massar, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood predicted that Bitcoin would still reach $500,000, sticking to her earlier target in spite of the ongoing sell-off.The superstar fund manager claims that Ark's conviction ""remains high"" when it comes to Bitcoin:We go through soul-searching times like this but our conviction on Bitcoin remains high.Wood says that the recent correction has boosted the chances of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since such a product is less likely to be greenlit when prices are at all-time highs.Earlier today, Bitcoin careened to nearly $30,000.In addition, the 65-year-old investor has weighed in on the Elon Musk debacle, speculating that he was pressured by shareholders like BlackRock to reverse course on Bitcoin. However, she expects him to come back to the community:I believe what happened is after he took a position on Bitcoin, he got pushback from institutional shareholders like BlackRock. You've got Larry Fink beating drum on climate change. I don't think he expected that. But I think he'll come back to the mix.RelatedElon Musk Says Tesla Has Diamond Hands, Pushing Bitcoin Sharply Higher Ark Invest is heavily invested both in the Tesla stock and in the shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).Alex Dovbnya (aka AlexMorris) is a cryptocurrency expert, trader and journalist with extensive experience of covering everything related to the burgeoning industry — from price analysis to Blockchain disruption.

"How Justin Sun Almost Caused Ethereum To Drop Below $1,500",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/justin-sun-almost-ethereum-drop/,05-20,"Image by: Julius Drost - UnsplashAfter a display of strength in the past weeks, Ethereum dropped below $2,000 for a brief moment. The cryptocurrency seems to be recovered, but the crypto market could still face some resistance to return to its pre-crash levels.A report by Wu Blockchain claims that ETH’s price barely escaped from a bigger fall. Data provided by Philippe Castonguay shows that Justin Sun, CEO at the Tron Foundation, has a $1 billion position on the Ethereum-based Liquity Protocol.This 606,000 ETH position was almost liquidated and, due to its size, could have caused the price to crashed below $1,500 or $1,000 approximately. Castonguay said:There was about a 2 minute window where Liquity Protocol went into recovery mode and Justin Sun’s $1B dollar position could’ve been liquidated, but it didn’t happen. He just rebalanced his Trove 5 minutes ago, paying $300m back of debt.However, Castonguay later clarified that the protocol’s liquidation mechanism would have prevented ETH’s price from plunging. Liquity operates with entities called stability providers. Once a position is liquidated a 0.5% percent goes to the liquidators and 9.5% is distributed to every stability provider. Castonguay added:His ETH would’ve been purchased by the Stability Providers at *market price*. Buyers would’ve met seller at the same spot price.JustinSun said in Chinese community: Like a bullet passing through the scalp, I saved the cryptocurrency… https://t.co/vG7GTeoeKF pic.twitter.com/FRMmaExnuq— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 19, 2021Sun took advantage of the drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price. Via his Twitter account, he announced two major BTC and ETH purchases. He made the announcement in the same fashion as major corporations have disclosed their crypto holdings.For the former, Sun claimed to have bought 4,145 BTC at an average price of $36,868 for an estimated $152 million. Sun said:I have bought many on a dip today, this is only my #BTC purchase. Keep BUIDLING, buy the DIP.The second purchase was made for 54,153 ETH at an average price of $2,509 for an estimated $135 million. Quoting MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, Sun said: “I’m not selling”.At the time of writing, ETH trades at $2,621 with a 21.6% loss in the daily chart. In the weekly chart ETH has a 37.1% dropped and in the monthly chart maintains a 17.2% profit.While the recovery has been impressive, the market might not be out of the woods. Data provided by Analyst Material Scientist on May 17th predicted a pullback on ETH against BTC. As the chart below shows, ETH had a retracement on this pair and could see further volatility in the coming days.Moreover, ETH and the rest of the market seem to have increased their level of correlation with Bitcoin, as it usually happens when any major price action occurs. In that sense, Material Scientists also expect BTC price to move sideways at current levels, at least, until June.

Bitcoin Plummets 30% as “Extreme Fear” Sets in on Crypto Markets,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-plummets-30-as-extreme-fear-sets-on-crypto-markets/,05-20,"The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a metric that’s known to measure current market sentiment, fell to its lowest point of 2021. The index, which has continued to fall alongside Bitcoin prices, hit “extreme fear” levels, which have not been observed since April 2020 during the global financial market crash. The metric has continued to reflect the bearish sentiment that seems to have overtaken the crypto markets. As Bitcoin extended its losses and briefly hit $31,600 today, the indicator collapsed to a record-low rating of 11. News of Tesla rejecting Bitcoin payments earlier last week turned the markets sour — leading to a massive broad market drawdown. At time of writing, Bitcoin is down 27.63% in a single week, with Ethereum, Binance Coin and Dogecoin down 41.83%, 50.32%, and 26.60%, respectively. Just earlier last month, the metric signalled that the crypto market was heavily overheated, with a rating of 73, or “Greed.” Up to that point, Bitcoin was up by more than 200% YTD. Short-term volatility also climbed to the highest level seen since last February. According to the Bitcoin Volatility Index, monthly volatility rose to 4.64%. Unfortunately, it’s likely that volatility is here to stay. According to Deribit Metrics, historical volatility for the options market surged to 131%, up from 67% just a week prior. The contract with the highest notional value and volume are May 28 50,000 puts, which are already in-the-money. With more than $1.6 billion worth of contracts set to expire by the end of May, there’s no doubt that Bitcoin will continue to face choppy price action.For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

VeChain (VET) verifies results of a 305 metric tonne plastic clean-up in the ocean,https://cryptoslate.com/vechain-vet-verifies-results-of-a-305-metric-tonne-plastic-clean-up-in-the-ocean/,05-20,"Earn up to 12% APY on Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD, EUR, GBP, Stablecoins & more.The blockchain found usage in verifiably tracing the results of an ecological project.ReSea Project, a Danish company with a community-driven solution to remove plastic from oceans and rivers in Indonesia, shared their Cleanup Impact Status on Linkedin yesterday, stating they cleared 305 metric tonnes of plastic waste from the ocean and verified the results using VeChain.“Our collection data from January-April 2021 is now verified by DNV and we are happy to share with you that we’ve removed 305.239,62 kg (672,938.17 lbs) of plastic waste from oceans and rivers,” they said in the post.VeChain’s ‘ToolChain platform’ traced the clean-up process, tracking plastic waste from the extraction point, how it was sorted, and when it was delivered at a local waste bank.The platform, based on blockchain technology, secures real-time data and records all the steps within the scope of certification. This enables DNV to digitally monitor and audit all plastic collections at all times, notifying all of the involved parties of any irregularities.The ReSea project is only the second in the world certified to the DNV’s Chain of Custody Standard for Plastics Retrieved in the Hydrosphere. The standard requirements assure the traceability and integrity of reclaimed plastic from any body of water. DNV is an expert assurance and risk management company that issued the first-ever traceability standard for verifying the authenticity and origin of the recovered ocean and river plastic.The certification helps push forward the cleanup efforts in Indonesia, the world’s second-largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution. As an independent third party, DNV also ensures fair compensation to cleanup teams, as people from local communities in Indonesia are employed to remove plastic waste from rivers and oceans.With a community-driven solution, ReSea is improving living conditions and raising awareness in areas with poor waste management. The high level of transparency into the collection process enables businesses to trust their involvement has an environmental and social impact.According to the Center for Biological diversity, the world is currently witnessing a global tragedy for our oceans and sea life. Accumulating plastic found in floating garbage patches already make up about 40 percent of the world’s ocean surfaces and at current rates, plastic is expected to outweigh all the fish in the sea by 2050.Besides reducing plastic consumption and improving waste management, large-scale cleanup solutions are crucial in mitigating the plastic pollution crisis. And seems like blockchain can help with that.  Access more crypto insights and context in every article as a paid member of CryptoSlate Edge.On July 5th, 2018, in partnership with KALTENDIN, high-end Chinese clothing brand, Waltonchain introduced the WTC-Garment System– the world's first blockchain-based, clothing authenticity traceability system.Cardano (ADA) parent IOHK announced a partnership yesterday with Wyoming-based BeefChain.China’s largest insurance conglomerate by total assets handled, the People’s Insurance Company of China (PICC), has partnered with VeChain, blockchain-based information tracking and governance systems company, with the goal of digitally transforming the insurance industry, according to a press release.Commitment to Transparency: The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

Judge Delivers Blow to Ripple Over Foreign Discovery,https://u.today/judge-delivers-blow-to-ripple-over-foreign-discovery,05-20,"Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn has denied Ripple’s motion to stop the U.S. Securities and Commission from sending Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) requests to foreign securities regulators.    

As reported by U.Today, Ripple claimed that such requests were meant to intimidate its foreign business partners, but the judge asserts that there is “no evidence” to suggest that they were issued “in bad faith.”   The defendants wanted to compel the SEC to use the slow and inefficient Hague Convention process, but Netburn says that the MoU requests are permissible:   There has been no argument that the Requests exceed the scope of any governing bilateral agreement. Instead, courts have routinely rejected the proposition that the Hague Convention is the exclusive or priority means of conducting foreign discovery.     The SEC has to produce all documents obtained through its MoU requests, but it can withhold privileged ones from production.Last month, the agency revealed that three foreign counterparts had refused to provide any assistance. RelatedRipple Announces Partnership with Egypt's Largest BankThe ruling on foreign requests is Ripple’s first major setback in discovery fights.   

In April, the judge partially granted Ripple’s motion to compel the discovery of documents related to XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. However, earlier this month, she clarified that Ripple cannot get access to the SEC staff’s personal emails.

In addition, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen successfully blocked the SEC’s requests for their personal banking records.

The SEC is now trying to compel Ripple to produce the legal advice it “sought or received” regarding XRP’s regulatory status, which would help it to strike the defendants' “fair notice” defense.Alex Dovbnya (aka AlexMorris) is a cryptocurrency expert, trader and journalist with extensive experience of covering everything related to the burgeoning industry — from price analysis to Blockchain disruption.

Elon Musk Hints Dogecoin May Reach $1,https://u.today/elon-musk-hints-dogecoin-may-reach-1,05-20,"Elon Musk has just taken to Twitter to talk DOGE again, posting a picture of a $1 note with a Shiba-Inu dog on it, suggesting this is his forecast of the meme-coin's price. The picture in the tweet refers to the Cyber Viking book series by Marcus Sloss.The books are about Saudi war veteran Eric Yang, who prepares to save the Earth from an alien attack. Recalling Musk calling Doge the ""people's currency,"" it is easy to assume that the eccentric billionaire is again shilling DOGE as the asset that will ""save the world"" without the world realizing it yet.The asteroid barreling toward Earth is an alien spacecraft with hostile intent. Eric scrambles to plan, consolidate, and form his team while the rest of an oblivious society is prevented from vital information.At press time, Dogecoin is changing hands at $0.3752, as per CoinMarketCap, after yesterday's plunge followed Bitcoin's downward trajectory from above $40,000 down by $10,000.Related$5.28B in Stablecoins Moved to Exchanges Followed by 19,639 BTC Withdrawn As Market Grabs Bitcoin Dip The Tesla CEO is a long-term DOGE fan.

Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 15% Thursday, recovering nearly all of the ground lost during the yesterday’s price plunge.As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $42,500. That’s roughly where it started on Wednesday, just before a 14% sell-off over the ensuing 24 hours – the biggest single-day decline since March 2020. Prices nearly fell below $30,000 at one point.   Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was also on the mend Thursday, up 20% to about $2,931 at press time. The price tumbled 28% over the course of Wednesday, briefly dipping below $2,000.Other cryptocurrencies joined in the rebound. All of the free-floating cryptocurrencies in the CoinDesk 20 were up over the past 24 hours, with cardano (ADA) jumping some 69% to $1.92. Bitcoin cash (BCH) surged 57% to $845.Wednesday’s spot market volume was one for the record books, according to CoinMarketCap. Some $131.1 billion in bitcoin changed hands, nearly $5 billion more than Tuesday’s figure and nearly double the dollar volume of March 12, 2020, the “Black Thursday” of crypto. However, it should be noted that bitcoin was trading at one-fifth its current price at that point. Thus, when measured on a bitcoin volume basis, March 2020’s sell-off was far worse.Bitcoin’s market dominance, a measure of its market cap relative to the total for all other cryptocurrencies, briefly fell below 40% on Wednesday for the first time since June 2018.Also read: Ark Investment’s Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Will Go to $500,000Ether also saw record volume in trading, with close to $93.5 billion of the cryptocurrency finding new owners Wednesday.The decentralized finance (DeFi) market was still feeling the heat from this week’s crypto market correction.

"Bitcoin (BTC) Peak: Wyckoff Distribution, 2013 Bull Run and Pi Cycle",https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-btc-peak-wyckoff-distribution-2013-bull-run-and-pi-cycle/,05-20,"We use cookies to improve your experience.Lost or forgotten your password? Please enter your email ddress. You will receive mail with link to set new password.Analysts point out that bitcoin's peak had the form of Wyckoff distribution.The ongoing correction on the BTC market resembles 2013.Pi Cycle Top correctly predicted the (local) bull market peak.Free Cloud Mining Providers to Mine Bitcoin in 2021 The cryptocurrency market has experienced a strong shock in recent days, culminating in bitcoin’s flash crash to $30,000 yesterday. 

While looking for the reasons for this extremely bearish price action, the cryptocurrency community saw several technical indicators and patterns that could be heralds of what was about to happen.One of them is the Wyckoff distribution. This pattern is used in traditional financial markets to describe the peak of a bull market (distribution) or the bottom of a bear market (accumulation).

The interpretation by YouTube user @uncomplication, who compared the BTC price action from the last few months to the Wyckoff distribution, was particularly insightful. The most interesting fact is that the YouTuber published his analysis on April 25, 24 days before yesterday’s crash.It is also worth recalling the signal that the community received about a month ago from the Pi Cycle Top indicator and the deepening fear on the market, which reached the extremely low value of 11 points. The Fear and Greed Index has recorded such extreme readings only 5 times in its history.The Wyckoff diagram is a pattern in technical analysis that has gained popularity in the analysis of traditional financial markets. Its creator was Richard Wyckoff (1873-1934), a famous investor in the stock markets and creator of Magazine of Wall Street. He is one of the pioneers of modern technical analysis.A typical Wyckoff pattern consists of a series of sharp up and down price movements that create some elongated distribution. One of the tops of the diagram is the peak for this period of price action followed by an accelerated decline.Wyckoff distribution pattern / Source: school.stockcharts.comTo get the most out of the Wyckoff diagram, it needs to be identified correctly. This is done using trading ranges, price volatility, and trading volume. Following this identification, the appropriate buying/selling decisions can be made. The main principle here is gradual selling during the distribution period and gradual purchasing during the accumulation period, which is approximately the opposite of the distribution pattern.Over the past 24 hours, many members of the crypto community have drawn attention to the similarities in the bitcoin price action over the past few months to the Wyckoff distribution pattern. Most of them referred to the almost prophetic video by @uncomplication. He diagnosed this pattern almost a month ago.For example, the cryptocurrency trader @KingThies posted a juxtaposition of two variations of the Wyckoff distribution with a linear bitcoin chart on Twitter. He highlighted the key levels of the trading range, resistance, support, and the main phases of the distribution itself.Source: TwitterAlso, crypto market analyst Benjamin Cowen published an analysis of the potential Wyckoff pattern in the context of his prediction of an intermediate peak in this bitcoin bull run. He argues that whether it results from a realized distribution or a mere reaction to an overheated market, many signals indicated that the ongoing run could significantly improve correction.Source: YouTubeKnown for using mathematical analysis tools, Cowen has repeatedly compared the current bull market to the price action from two cycles ago. During this period, bitcoin’s exponential increase led to a deeper correction. It then continued its upward move to a new all-time high set a few months later.This idea about the similarities between the current cycle and the 2013-2014 period seems to also be supported by the well-known investor and bitcoin bull Raoul Pal. In a tweet today, he published a chart that compares the bitcoin price from these two bull markets. As it turns out, the similarities are indeed visible.Source: TwitterHowever, it was not only the Wyckoff distribution that turned out to be a harbinger of the coming drop. It is also worth mentioning the Pi Cycle Top indicator, which BeInCrypto wrote about during its recent intersection.In retrospect, it turned out that it had predicted the (local) top of the bull run very accurately again. Despite many not believing it on the day it crossed. This simple indicator is based on the movements of two curves: twice the 350-day DMA and the 111-day DMA.Their last intersection took place on April 12, just 2 days before the all-time high at $64,895.BTC chart by TradingviewInterestingly, a few days later, the curves made another intersection. Also, today they are again far apart at around $2,500. This means that if the market is to bounce soon and the bullish sentiment returns, the indicator would again be ready to point to a potential peak.Finally, pay attention to the behavior of the Fear and Greed Index. It is currently at its lowest levels since the COVID-19 crisis. Today, when market sentiment responds to yesterday’s crash, its value has dropped to 11/100.Current readings of the Fear and Greed Index / Source: alternative.meThis is an extremely low level of the indicator.  Such a low rating has only been recorded only 5 times since its inception (orange circles).Historical readings of the Fear and Greed Index / Source: alternative.meExtremely negative sentiment in the crypto market may indicate that the correction is not over yet. Any possible consolidation may take months. However, this indicator should be a good suggestion for new investors that now is the right time to consider taking positions with much lower risk compared to a month ago.
