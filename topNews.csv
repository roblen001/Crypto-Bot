"Ark's Cathie Wood Predicts Bitcoin Could Hit $500,000, Says Correction Is Good for ETF Approval",https://u.today/arks-cathie-wood-predicts-bitcoin-could-hit-500000-says-correction-is-good-for-etf-approval,19-05,"In a recent interview with Bloomberg's Carol Massar, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood predicted that Bitcoin would still reach $500,000, sticking to her earlier target in spite of the ongoing sell-off.The superstar fund manager claims that Ark's conviction ""remains high"" when it comes to Bitcoin:We go through soul-searching times like this but our conviction on Bitcoin remains high.Wood says that the recent correction has boosted the chances of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since such a product is less likely to be greenlit when prices are at all-time highs.Earlier today, Bitcoin careened to nearly $30,000.In addition, the 65-year-old investor has weighed in on the Elon Musk debacle, speculating that he was pressured by shareholders like BlackRock to reverse course on Bitcoin. However, she expects him to come back to the community:I believe what happened is after he took a position on Bitcoin, he got pushback from institutional shareholders like BlackRock.

"How Justin Sun Almost Caused Ethereum To Drop Below $1,500",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/justin-sun-almost-ethereum-drop/,05-20,"Image by: Julius Drost - UnsplashAfter a display of strength in the past weeks, Ethereum dropped below $2,000 for a brief moment. The cryptocurrency seems to be recovered, but the crypto market could still face some resistance to return to its pre-crash levels.A report by Wu Blockchain claims that ETH’s price barely escaped from a bigger fall. Data provided by Philippe Castonguay shows that Justin Sun, CEO at the Tron Foundation, has a $1 billion position on the Ethereum-based Liquity Protocol.This 606,000 ETH position was almost liquidated and, due to its size, could have caused the price to crashed below $1,500 or $1,000 approximately. Castonguay said:There was about a 2 minute window where Liquity Protocol went into recovery mode and Justin Sun’s $1B dollar position could’ve been liquidated, but it didn’t happen. He just rebalanced his Trove 5 minutes ago, paying $300m back of debt.However, Castonguay later clarified that the protocol’s liquidation mechanism would have prevented ETH’s price from plunging. Liquity operates with entities called stability providers. Once a position is liquidated a 0.5% percent goes to the liquidators and 9.5% is distributed to every stability provider. Castonguay added:His ETH would’ve been purchased by the Stability Providers at *market price*. Buyers would’ve met seller at the same spot price.JustinSun said in Chinese community: Like a bullet passing through the scalp, I saved the cryptocurrency… https://t.co/vG7GTeoeKF pic.twitter.com/FRMmaExnuq— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 19, 2021Sun took advantage of the drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price. Via his Twitter account, he announced two major BTC and ETH purchases. He made the announcement in the same fashion as major corporations have disclosed their crypto holdings.For the former, Sun claimed to have bought 4,145 BTC at an average price of $36,868 for an estimated $152 million. Sun said:I have bought many on a dip today, this is only my #BTC purchase. Keep BUIDLING, buy the DIP.The second purchase was made for 54,153 ETH at an average price of $2,509 for an estimated $135 million. Quoting MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, Sun said: “I’m not selling”.At the time of writing, ETH trades at $2,621 with a 21.6% loss in the daily chart. In the weekly chart ETH has a 37.1% dropped and in the monthly chart maintains a 17.2% profit.While the recovery has been impressive, the market might not be out of the woods. Data provided by Analyst Material Scientist on May 17th predicted a pullback on ETH against BTC. As the chart below shows, ETH had a retracement on this pair and could see further volatility in the coming days.Moreover, ETH and the rest of the market seem to have increased their level of correlation with Bitcoin, as it usually happens when any major price action occurs. In that sense, Material Scientists also expect BTC price to move sideways at current levels, at least, until June.

Bitcoin Plummets 30% as “Extreme Fear” Sets in on Crypto Markets,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-plummets-30-as-extreme-fear-sets-on-crypto-markets/,05-20,"The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a metric that’s known to measure current market sentiment, fell to its lowest point of 2021. The index, which has continued to fall alongside Bitcoin prices, hit “extreme fear” levels, which have not been observed since April 2020 during the global financial market crash. The metric has continued to reflect the bearish sentiment that seems to have overtaken the crypto markets. As Bitcoin extended its losses and briefly hit $31,600 today, the indicator collapsed to a record-low rating of 11. News of Tesla rejecting Bitcoin payments earlier last week turned the markets sour — leading to a massive broad market drawdown. At time of writing, Bitcoin is down 27.63% in a single week, with Ethereum, Binance Coin and Dogecoin down 41.83%, 50.32%, and 26.60%, respectively. Just earlier last month, the metric signalled that the crypto market was heavily overheated, with a rating of 73, or “Greed.” Up to that point, Bitcoin was up by more than 200% YTD. Short-term volatility also climbed to the highest level seen since last February. According to the Bitcoin Volatility Index, monthly volatility rose to 4.64%. Unfortunately, it’s likely that volatility is here to stay. According to Deribit Metrics, historical volatility for the options market surged to 131%, up from 67% just a week prior. The contract with the highest notional value and volume are May 28 50,000 puts, which are already in-the-money. With more than $1.6 billion worth of contracts set to expire by the end of May, there’s no doubt that Bitcoin will continue to face choppy price action.For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

VeChain (VET) verifies results of a 305 metric tonne plastic clean-up in the ocean,https://cryptoslate.com/vechain-vet-verifies-results-of-a-305-metric-tonne-plastic-clean-up-in-the-ocean/,05-20,"Earn up to 12% APY on Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD, EUR, GBP, Stablecoins & more.The blockchain found usage in verifiably tracing the results of an ecological project.ReSea Project, a Danish company with a community-driven solution to remove plastic from oceans and rivers in Indonesia, shared their Cleanup Impact Status on Linkedin yesterday, stating they cleared 305 metric tonnes of plastic waste from the ocean and verified the results using VeChain.“Our collection data from January-April 2021 is now verified by DNV and we are happy to share with you that we’ve removed 305.239,62 kg (672,938.17 lbs) of plastic waste from oceans and rivers,” they said in the post.VeChain’s ‘ToolChain platform’ traced the clean-up process, tracking plastic waste from the extraction point, how it was sorted, and when it was delivered at a local waste bank.The platform, based on blockchain technology, secures real-time data and records all the steps within the scope of certification. This enables DNV to digitally monitor and audit all plastic collections at all times, notifying all of the involved parties of any irregularities.The ReSea project is only the second in the world certified to the DNV’s Chain of Custody Standard for Plastics Retrieved in the Hydrosphere. The standard requirements assure the traceability and integrity of reclaimed plastic from any body of water. DNV is an expert assurance and risk management company that issued the first-ever traceability standard for verifying the authenticity and origin of the recovered ocean and river plastic.The certification helps push forward the cleanup efforts in Indonesia, the world’s second-largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution. As an independent third party, DNV also ensures fair compensation to cleanup teams, as people from local communities in Indonesia are employed to remove plastic waste from rivers and oceans.With a community-driven solution, ReSea is improving living conditions and raising awareness in areas with poor waste management. The high level of transparency into the collection process enables businesses to trust their involvement has an environmental and social impact.According to the Center for Biological diversity, the world is currently witnessing a global tragedy for our oceans and sea life. Accumulating plastic found in floating garbage patches already make up about 40 percent of the world’s ocean surfaces and at current rates, plastic is expected to outweigh all the fish in the sea by 2050.Besides reducing plastic consumption and improving waste management, large-scale cleanup solutions are crucial in mitigating the plastic pollution crisis. And seems like blockchain can help with that.  Access more crypto insights and context in every article as a paid member of CryptoSlate Edge.On July 5th, 2018, in partnership with KALTENDIN, high-end Chinese clothing brand, Waltonchain introduced the WTC-Garment System– the world's first blockchain-based, clothing authenticity traceability system.Cardano (ADA) parent IOHK announced a partnership yesterday with Wyoming-based BeefChain.China’s largest insurance conglomerate by total assets handled, the People’s Insurance Company of China (PICC), has partnered with VeChain, blockchain-based information tracking and governance systems company, with the goal of digitally transforming the insurance industry, according to a press release.Commitment to Transparency: The author of this article is invested and/or has an interest in one or more assets discussed in this post.

Judge Delivers Blow to Ripple Over Foreign Discovery,https://u.today/judge-delivers-blow-to-ripple-over-foreign-discovery,05-20,"Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn has denied Ripple’s motion to stop the U.S. Securities and Commission from sending Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) requests to foreign securities regulators.    

As reported by U.Today, Ripple claimed that such requests were meant to intimidate its foreign business partners, but the judge asserts that there is “no evidence” to suggest that they were issued “in bad faith.”   The defendants wanted to compel the SEC to use the slow and inefficient Hague Convention process, but Netburn says that the MoU requests are permissible:   There has been no argument that the Requests exceed the scope of any governing bilateral agreement. Instead, courts have routinely rejected the proposition that the Hague Convention is the exclusive or priority means of conducting foreign discovery.     The SEC has to produce all documents obtained through its MoU requests, but it can withhold privileged ones from production.Last month, the agency revealed that three foreign counterparts had refused to provide any assistance. RelatedRipple Announces Partnership with Egypt's Largest BankThe ruling on foreign requests is Ripple’s first major setback in discovery fights.   

In April, the judge partially granted Ripple’s motion to compel the discovery of documents related to XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. However, earlier this month, she clarified that Ripple cannot get access to the SEC staff’s personal emails.

In addition, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen successfully blocked the SEC’s requests for their personal banking records.

The SEC is now trying to compel Ripple to produce the legal advice it “sought or received” regarding XRP’s regulatory status, which would help it to strike the defendants' “fair notice” defense.Alex Dovbnya (aka AlexMorris) is a cryptocurrency expert, trader and journalist with extensive experience of covering everything related to the burgeoning industry — from price analysis to Blockchain disruption.

Elon Musk Hints Dogecoin May Reach $1,https://u.today/elon-musk-hints-dogecoin-may-reach-1,05-20,"Elon Musk has just taken to Twitter to talk DOGE again, posting a picture of a $1 note with a Shiba-Inu dog on it, suggesting this is his forecast of the meme-coin's price. The picture in the tweet refers to the Cyber Viking book series by Marcus Sloss.The books are about Saudi war veteran Eric Yang, who prepares to save the Earth from an alien attack. Recalling Musk calling Doge the ""people's currency,"" it is easy to assume that the eccentric billionaire is again shilling DOGE as the asset that will ""save the world"" without the world realizing it yet.The asteroid barreling toward Earth is an alien spacecraft with hostile intent. Eric scrambles to plan, consolidate, and form his team while the rest of an oblivious society is prevented from vital information.At press time, Dogecoin is changing hands at $0.3752, as per CoinMarketCap, after yesterday's plunge followed Bitcoin's downward trajectory from above $40,000 down by $10,000.Related$5.28B in Stablecoins Moved to Exchanges Followed by 19,639 BTC Withdrawn As Market Grabs Bitcoin Dip The Tesla CEO is a long-term DOGE fan. He often posts tweets related to DOGE and pushing the coin's price to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 15% Thursday, recovering nearly all of the ground lost during the yesterday’s price plunge.As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $42,500. That’s roughly where it started on Wednesday, just before a 14% sell-off over the ensuing 24 hours – the biggest single-day decline since March 2020. Prices nearly fell below $30,000 at one point.   Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was also on the mend Thursday, up 20% to about $2,931 at press time. The price tumbled 28% over the course of Wednesday, briefly dipping below $2,000.Other cryptocurrencies joined in the rebound. All of the free-floating cryptocurrencies in the CoinDesk 20 were up over the past 24 hours, with cardano (ADA) jumping some 69% to $1.92. Bitcoin cash (BCH) surged 57% to $845.Wednesday’s spot market volume was one for the record books, according to CoinMarketCap. Some $131.1 billion in bitcoin changed hands, nearly $5 billion more than Tuesday’s figure and nearly double the dollar volume of March 12, 2020, the “Black Thursday” of crypto. However, it should be noted that bitcoin was trading at one-fifth its current price at that point. Thus, when measured on a bitcoin volume basis, March 2020’s sell-off was far worse.Bitcoin’s market dominance, a measure of its market cap relative to the total for all other cryptocurrencies, briefly fell below 40% on Wednesday for the first time since June 2018.Also read: Ark Investment’s Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Will Go to $500,000Ether also saw record volume in trading, with close to $93.5 billion of the cryptocurrency finding new owners Wednesday.The decentralized finance (DeFi) market was still feeling the heat from this week’s crypto market correction. The total amount of assets locked in DeFi is just above $65 billion, down from an all-time high of $88 billion on May 11, according to data site DeFiPulse.com. Despite the rough stretch, cryptocurrencies are still trouncing almost all other asset classes this year.

"Bitcoin (BTC) Peak: Wyckoff Distribution, 2013 Bull Run and Pi Cycle",https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-btc-peak-wyckoff-distribution-2013-bull-run-and-pi-cycle/,05-20,"We use cookies to improve your experience.Lost or forgotten your password? Please enter your email ddress. You will receive mail with link to set new password.Analysts point out that bitcoin's peak had the form of Wyckoff distribution.The ongoing correction on the BTC market resembles 2013.Pi Cycle Top correctly predicted the (local) bull market peak.Free Cloud Mining Providers to Mine Bitcoin in 2021 The cryptocurrency market has experienced a strong shock in recent days, culminating in bitcoin’s flash crash to $30,000 yesterday. 

While looking for the reasons for this extremely bearish price action, the cryptocurrency community saw several technical indicators and patterns that could be heralds of what was about to happen.One of them is the Wyckoff distribution. This pattern is used in traditional financial markets to describe the peak of a bull market (distribution) or the bottom of a bear market (accumulation).

The interpretation by YouTube user @uncomplication, who compared the BTC price action from the last few months to the Wyckoff distribution, was particularly insightful. The most interesting fact is that the YouTuber published his analysis on April 25, 24 days before yesterday’s crash.It is also worth recalling the signal that the community received about a month ago from the Pi Cycle Top indicator and the deepening fear on the market, which reached the extremely low value of 11 points. The Fear and Greed Index has recorded such extreme readings only 5 times in its history.The Wyckoff diagram is a pattern in technical analysis that has gained popularity in the analysis of traditional financial markets. Its creator was Richard Wyckoff (1873-1934), a famous investor in the stock markets and creator of Magazine of Wall Street. He is one of the pioneers of modern technical analysis.A typical Wyckoff pattern consists of a series of sharp up and down price movements that create some elongated distribution. One of the tops of the diagram is the peak for this period of price action followed by an accelerated decline.Wyckoff distribution pattern / Source: school.stockcharts.comTo get the most out of the Wyckoff diagram, it needs to be identified correctly. This is done using trading ranges, price volatility, and trading volume. Following this identification, the appropriate buying/selling decisions can be made. The main principle here is gradual selling during the distribution period and gradual purchasing during the accumulation period, which is approximately the opposite of the distribution pattern.Over the past 24 hours, many members of the crypto community have drawn attention to the similarities in the bitcoin price action over the past few months to the Wyckoff distribution pattern. Most of them referred to the almost prophetic video by @uncomplication. He diagnosed this pattern almost a month ago.For example, the cryptocurrency trader @KingThies posted a juxtaposition of two variations of the Wyckoff distribution with a linear bitcoin chart on Twitter. He highlighted the key levels of the trading range, resistance, support, and the main phases of the distribution itself.Source: TwitterAlso, crypto market analyst Benjamin Cowen published an analysis of the potential Wyckoff pattern in the context of his prediction of an intermediate peak in this bitcoin bull run. He argues that whether it results from a realized distribution or a mere reaction to an overheated market, many signals indicated that the ongoing run could significantly improve correction.Source: YouTubeKnown for using mathematical analysis tools, Cowen has repeatedly compared the current bull market to the price action from two cycles ago. During this period, bitcoin’s exponential increase led to a deeper correction. It then continued its upward move to a new all-time high set a few months later.This idea about the similarities between the current cycle and the 2013-2014 period seems to also be supported by the well-known investor and bitcoin bull Raoul Pal. In a tweet today, he published a chart that compares the bitcoin price from these two bull markets. As it turns out, the similarities are indeed visible.Source: TwitterHowever, it was not only the Wyckoff distribution that turned out to be a harbinger of the coming drop. It is also worth mentioning the Pi Cycle Top indicator, which BeInCrypto wrote about during its recent intersection.In retrospect, it turned out that it had predicted the (local) top of the bull run very accurately again. Despite many not believing it on the day it crossed. This simple indicator is based on the movements of two curves: twice the 350-day DMA and the 111-day DMA.Their last intersection took place on April 12, just 2 days before the all-time high at $64,895.BTC chart by TradingviewInterestingly, a few days later, the curves made another intersection. Also, today they are again far apart at around $2,500. This means that if the market is to bounce soon and the bullish sentiment returns, the indicator would again be ready to point to a potential peak.Finally, pay attention to the behavior of the Fear and Greed Index. It is currently at its lowest levels since the COVID-19 crisis. Today, when market sentiment responds to yesterday’s crash, its value has dropped to 11/100.Current readings of the Fear and Greed Index / Source: alternative.meThis is an extremely low level of the indicator.  Such a low rating has only been recorded only 5 times since its inception (orange circles).Historical readings of the Fear and Greed Index / Source: alternative.meExtremely negative sentiment in the crypto market may indicate that the correction is not over yet. Any possible consolidation may take months. However, this indicator should be a good suggestion for new investors that now is the right time to consider taking positions with much lower risk compared to a month ago.

"How Justin Sun Almost Caused Ethereum To Drop Below $1,500",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/justin-sun-almost-ethereum-drop/,20-05,"Image by: Julius Drost - UnsplashAfter a display of strength in the past weeks, Ethereum dropped below $2,000 for a brief moment. The cryptocurrency seems to be recovered, but the crypto market could still face some resistance to return to its pre-crash levels.A report by Wu Blockchain claims that ETH’s price barely escaped from a bigger fall. Data provided by Philippe Castonguay shows that Justin Sun, CEO at the Tron Foundation, has a $1 billion position on the Ethereum-based Liquity Protocol.This 606,000 ETH position was almost liquidated and, due to its size, could have caused the price to crashed below $1,500 or $1,000 approximately. Castonguay said:There was about a 2 minute window where Liquity Protocol went into recovery mode and Justin Sun’s $1B dollar position could’ve been liquidated, but it didn’t happen. He just rebalanced his Trove 5 minutes ago, paying $300m back of debt.However, Castonguay later clarified that the protocol’s liquidation mechanism would have prevented ETH’s price from plunging. Liquity operates with entities called stability providers. Once a position is liquidated a 0.5% percent goes to the liquidators and 9.5% is distributed to every stability provider. Castonguay added:His ETH would’ve been purchased by the Stability Providers at *market price*. Buyers would’ve met seller at the same spot price.JustinSun said in Chinese community: Like a bullet passing through the scalp, I saved the cryptocurrency… https://t.co/vG7GTeoeKF pic.twitter.com/FRMmaExnuq— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 19, 2021Sun took advantage of the drop in Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price. Via his Twitter account, he announced two major BTC and ETH purchases. He made the announcement in the same fashion as major corporations have disclosed their crypto holdings.For the former, Sun claimed to have bought 4,145 BTC at an average price of $36,868 for an estimated $152 million. Sun said:I have bought many on a dip today, this is only my #BTC purchase. Keep BUIDLING, buy the DIP.The second purchase was made for 54,153 ETH at an average price of $2,509 for an estimated $135 million. Quoting MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, Sun said: “I’m not selling”.At the time of writing, ETH trades at $2,621 with a 21.6% loss in the daily chart. In the weekly chart ETH has a 37.1% dropped and in the monthly chart maintains a 17.2% profit.While the recovery has been impressive, the market might not be out of the woods. Data provided by Analyst Material Scientist on May 17th predicted a pullback on ETH against BTC. As the chart below shows, ETH had a retracement on this pair and could see further volatility in the coming days.Moreover, ETH and the rest of the market seem to have increased their level of correlation with Bitcoin, as it usually happens when any major price action occurs. In that sense, Material Scientists also expect BTC price to move sideways at current levels, at least, until June.

Bitcoin Plummets 30% as “Extreme Fear” Sets in on Crypto Markets,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-plummets-30-as-extreme-fear-sets-on-crypto-markets/,20-05,"The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a metric that’s known to measure current market sentiment, fell to its lowest point of 2021. The index, which has continued to fall alongside Bitcoin prices, hit “extreme fear” levels, which have not been observed since April 2020 during the global financial market crash. The metric has continued to reflect the bearish sentiment that seems to have overtaken the crypto markets. As Bitcoin extended its losses and briefly hit $31,600 today, the indicator collapsed to a record-low rating of 11. News of Tesla rejecting Bitcoin payments earlier last week turned the markets sour — leading to a massive broad market drawdown. At time of writing, Bitcoin is down 27.63% in a single week, with Ethereum, Binance Coin and Dogecoin down 41.83%, 50.32%, and 26.60%, respectively. Just earlier last month, the metric signalled that the crypto market was heavily overheated, with a rating of 73, or “Greed.” Up to that point, Bitcoin was up by more than 200% YTD. Short-term volatility also climbed to the highest level seen since last February. According to the Bitcoin Volatility Index, monthly volatility rose to 4.64%. Unfortunately, it’s likely that volatility is here to stay. According to Deribit Metrics, historical volatility for the options market surged to 131%, up from 67% just a week prior. The contract with the highest notional value and volume are May 28 50,000 puts, which are already in-the-money. With more than $1.6 billion worth of contracts set to expire by the end of May, there’s no doubt that Bitcoin will continue to face choppy price action.For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

VeChain (VET) verifies results of a 305 metric tonne plastic clean-up in the ocean,https://cryptoslate.com/vechain-vet-verifies-results-of-a-305-metric-tonne-plastic-clean-up-in-the-ocean/,20-05,"Earn up to 12% APY on Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD, EUR, GBP, Stablecoins & more.The blockchain found usage in verifiably tracing the results of an ecological project.ReSea Project, a Danish company with a community-driven solution to remove plastic from oceans and rivers in Indonesia, shared their Cleanup Impact Status on Linkedin yesterday, stating they cleared 305 metric tonnes of plastic waste from the ocean and verified the results using VeChain.“Our collection data from January-April 2021 is now verified by DNV and we are happy to share with you that we’ve removed 305.239,62 kg (672,938.17 lbs) of plastic waste from oceans and rivers,” they said in the post.VeChain’s ‘ToolChain platform’ traced the clean-up process, tracking plastic waste from the extraction point, how it was sorted, and when it was delivered at a local waste bank.The platform, based on blockchain technology, secures real-time data and records all the steps within the scope of certification. This enables DNV to digitally monitor and audit all plastic collections at all times, notifying all of the involved parties of any irregularities.The ReSea project is only the second in the world certified to the DNV’s Chain of Custody Standard for Plastics Retrieved in the Hydrosphere. The standard requirements assure the traceability and integrity of reclaimed plastic from any body of water. DNV is an expert assurance and risk management company that issued the first-ever traceability standard for verifying the authenticity and origin of the recovered ocean and river plastic.The certification helps push forward the cleanup efforts in Indonesia, the world’s second-largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution. As an independent third party, DNV also ensures fair compensation to cleanup teams, as people from local communities in Indonesia are employed to remove plastic waste from rivers and oceans.With a community-driven solution, ReSea is improving living conditions and raising awareness in areas with poor waste management. The high level of transparency into the collection process enables businesses to trust their involvement has an environmental and social impact.According to the Center for Biological diversity, the world is currently witnessing a global tragedy for our oceans and sea life. Accumulating plastic found in floating garbage patches already make up about 40 percent of the world’s ocean surfaces and at current rates, plastic is expected to outweigh all the fish in the sea by 2050.Besides reducing plastic consumption and improving waste management, large-scale cleanup solutions are crucial in mitigating the plastic pollution crisis.

Judge Delivers Blow to Ripple Over Foreign Discovery,https://u.today/judge-delivers-blow-to-ripple-over-foreign-discovery,20-05,"Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn has denied Ripple’s motion to stop the U.S. Securities and Commission from sending Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) requests to foreign securities regulators.    

As reported by U.Today, Ripple claimed that such requests were meant to intimidate its foreign business partners, but the judge asserts that there is “no evidence” to suggest that they were issued “in bad faith.”   The defendants wanted to compel the SEC to use the slow and inefficient Hague Convention process, but Netburn says that the MoU requests are permissible:   There has been no argument that the Requests exceed the scope of any governing bilateral agreement. Instead, courts have routinely rejected the proposition that the Hague Convention is the exclusive or priority means of conducting foreign discovery.     The SEC has to produce all documents obtained through its MoU requests, but it can withhold privileged ones from production.Last month, the agency revealed that three foreign counterparts had refused to provide any assistance. RelatedRipple Announces Partnership with Egypt's Largest BankThe ruling on foreign requests is Ripple’s first major setback in discovery fights.   

In April, the judge partially granted Ripple’s motion to compel the discovery of documents related to XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. However, earlier this month, she clarified that Ripple cannot get access to the SEC staff’s personal emails.

In addition, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen successfully blocked the SEC’s requests for their personal banking records.

The SEC is now trying to compel Ripple to produce the legal advice it “sought or received” regarding XRP’s regulatory status, which would help it to strike the defendants' “fair notice” defense.Alex Dovbnya (aka AlexMorris) is a cryptocurrency expert, trader and journalist with extensive experience of covering everything related to the burgeoning industry — from price analysis to Blockchain disruption.

Elon Musk Hints Dogecoin May Reach $1,https://u.today/elon-musk-hints-dogecoin-may-reach-1,20-05,"Elon Musk has just taken to Twitter to talk DOGE again, posting a picture of a $1 note with a Shiba-Inu dog on it, suggesting this is his forecast of the meme-coin's price. The picture in the tweet refers to the Cyber Viking book series by Marcus Sloss.The books are about Saudi war veteran Eric Yang, who prepares to save the Earth from an alien attack. Recalling Musk calling Doge the ""people's currency,"" it is easy to assume that the eccentric billionaire is again shilling DOGE as the asset that will ""save the world"" without the world realizing it yet.The asteroid barreling toward Earth is an alien spacecraft with hostile intent. Eric scrambles to plan, consolidate, and form his team while the rest of an oblivious society is prevented from vital information.At press time, Dogecoin is changing hands at $0.3752, as per CoinMarketCap, after yesterday's plunge followed Bitcoin's downward trajectory from above $40,000 down by $10,000.Related$5.28B in Stablecoins Moved to Exchanges Followed by 19,639 BTC Withdrawn As Market Grabs Bitcoin Dip The Tesla CEO is a long-term DOGE fan.

Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 15% Thursday, recovering nearly all of the ground lost during the yesterday’s price plunge.As of press time, the largest cryptocurrency was changing hands around $42,500. That’s roughly where it started on Wednesday, just before a 14% sell-off over the ensuing 24 hours – the biggest single-day decline since March 2020. Prices nearly fell below $30,000 at one point.   Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was also on the mend Thursday, up 20% to about $2,931 at press time. The price tumbled 28% over the course of Wednesday, briefly dipping below $2,000.Other cryptocurrencies joined in the rebound. All of the free-floating cryptocurrencies in the CoinDesk 20 were up over the past 24 hours, with cardano (ADA) jumping some 69% to $1.92. Bitcoin cash (BCH) surged 57% to $845.Wednesday’s spot market volume was one for the record books, according to CoinMarketCap. Some $131.1 billion in bitcoin changed hands, nearly $5 billion more than Tuesday’s figure and nearly double the dollar volume of March 12, 2020, the “Black Thursday” of crypto. However, it should be noted that bitcoin was trading at one-fifth its current price at that point. Thus, when measured on a bitcoin volume basis, March 2020’s sell-off was far worse.Bitcoin’s market dominance, a measure of its market cap relative to the total for all other cryptocurrencies, briefly fell below 40% on Wednesday for the first time since June 2018.Also read: Ark Investment’s Cathie Wood Says Bitcoin Will Go to $500,000Ether also saw record volume in trading, with close to $93.5 billion of the cryptocurrency finding new owners Wednesday.The decentralized finance (DeFi) market was still feeling the heat from this week’s crypto market correction. The total amount of assets locked in DeFi is just above $65 billion, down from an all-time high of $88 billion on May 11, according to data site DeFiPulse.com. Despite the rough stretch, cryptocurrencies are still trouncing almost all other asset classes this year.

"Bitcoin (BTC) Peak: Wyckoff Distribution, 2013 Bull Run and Pi Cycle",https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-btc-peak-wyckoff-distribution-2013-bull-run-and-pi-cycle/,20-05,"We use cookies to improve your experience.Lost or forgotten your password? Please enter your email ddress. You will receive mail with link to set new password.Analysts point out that bitcoin's peak had the form of Wyckoff distribution.The ongoing correction on the BTC market resembles 2013.Pi Cycle Top correctly predicted the (local) bull market peak.Free Cloud Mining Providers to Mine Bitcoin in 2021 The cryptocurrency market has experienced a strong shock in recent days, culminating in bitcoin’s flash crash to $30,000 yesterday. 

While looking for the reasons for this extremely bearish price action, the cryptocurrency community saw several technical indicators and patterns that could be heralds of what was about to happen.One of them is the Wyckoff distribution. This pattern is used in traditional financial markets to describe the peak of a bull market (distribution) or the bottom of a bear market (accumulation).

The interpretation by YouTube user @uncomplication, who compared the BTC price action from the last few months to the Wyckoff distribution, was particularly insightful. The most interesting fact is that the YouTuber published his analysis on April 25, 24 days before yesterday’s crash.It is also worth recalling the signal that the community received about a month ago from the Pi Cycle Top indicator and the deepening fear on the market, which reached the extremely low value of 11 points. The Fear and Greed Index has recorded such extreme readings only 5 times in its history.The Wyckoff diagram is a pattern in technical analysis that has gained popularity in the analysis of traditional financial markets. Its creator was Richard Wyckoff (1873-1934), a famous investor in the stock markets and creator of Magazine of Wall Street. He is one of the pioneers of modern technical analysis.A typical Wyckoff pattern consists of a series of sharp up and down price movements that create some elongated distribution. One of the tops of the diagram is the peak for this period of price action followed by an accelerated decline.Wyckoff distribution pattern / Source: school.stockcharts.comTo get the most out of the Wyckoff diagram, it needs to be identified correctly. This is done using trading ranges, price volatility, and trading volume. Following this identification, the appropriate buying/selling decisions can be made. The main principle here is gradual selling during the distribution period and gradual purchasing during the accumulation period, which is approximately the opposite of the distribution pattern.Over the past 24 hours, many members of the crypto community have drawn attention to the similarities in the bitcoin price action over the past few months to the Wyckoff distribution pattern. Most of them referred to the almost prophetic video by @uncomplication. He diagnosed this pattern almost a month ago.For example, the cryptocurrency trader @KingThies posted a juxtaposition of two variations of the Wyckoff distribution with a linear bitcoin chart on Twitter. He highlighted the key levels of the trading range, resistance, support, and the main phases of the distribution itself.Source: TwitterAlso, crypto market analyst Benjamin Cowen published an analysis of the potential Wyckoff pattern in the context of his prediction of an intermediate peak in this bitcoin bull run. He argues that whether it results from a realized distribution or a mere reaction to an overheated market, many signals indicated that the ongoing run could significantly improve correction.Source: YouTubeKnown for using mathematical analysis tools, Cowen has repeatedly compared the current bull market to the price action from two cycles ago. During this period, bitcoin’s exponential increase led to a deeper correction. It then continued its upward move to a new all-time high set a few months later.This idea about the similarities between the current cycle and the 2013-2014 period seems to also be supported by the well-known investor and bitcoin bull Raoul Pal. In a tweet today, he published a chart that compares the bitcoin price from these two bull markets. As it turns out, the similarities are indeed visible.Source: TwitterHowever, it was not only the Wyckoff distribution that turned out to be a harbinger of the coming drop. It is also worth mentioning the Pi Cycle Top indicator, which BeInCrypto wrote about during its recent intersection.In retrospect, it turned out that it had predicted the (local) top of the bull run very accurately again. Despite many not believing it on the day it crossed. This simple indicator is based on the movements of two curves: twice the 350-day DMA and the 111-day DMA.Their last intersection took place on April 12, just 2 days before the all-time high at $64,895.BTC chart by TradingviewInterestingly, a few days later, the curves made another intersection. Also, today they are again far apart at around $2,500. This means that if the market is to bounce soon and the bullish sentiment returns, the indicator would again be ready to point to a potential peak.Finally, pay attention to the behavior of the Fear and Greed Index. It is currently at its lowest levels since the COVID-19 crisis. Today, when market sentiment responds to yesterday’s crash, its value has dropped to 11/100.Current readings of the Fear and Greed Index / Source: alternative.meThis is an extremely low level of the indicator.  Such a low rating has only been recorded only 5 times since its inception (orange circles).Historical readings of the Fear and Greed Index / Source: alternative.meExtremely negative sentiment in the crypto market may indicate that the correction is not over yet. Any possible consolidation may take months. However, this indicator should be a good suggestion for new investors that now is the right time to consider taking positions with much lower risk compared to a month ago.

The Tesla CEO has just tweeted that he doesn't plan to sell any of his Dogecoin holdings in his response to YouTuber Dave Lee. Earlier today, Musk posted a one-dollar bill with Shiba Inu, implying that the meme cryptocurrency could reach the much-coveted price mark. Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.39 on the Binance exchange.RelatedCardano Creator Wants to Help Elon Musk Fix DogecoinThe billionaire also said that Tesla had ""diamond hands"" because of CFO Zach ""Master of Coin"" Kirkhorn in a May 19 tweet, pushing Bitcoin significantly higher during a brutal sell-off.  The e-car manufacturer still holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet despite no longer accepting it as a means of payment due to environmental concerns.     Alex Dovbnya (aka AlexMorris) is a cryptocurrency expert, trader and journalist with extensive experience of covering everything related to the burgeoning industry — from price analysis to Blockchain disruption.

"These Six Crypto Assets Could Rise 10x This Year, Says Trader Lark Davis",https://dailyhodl.com/2021/05/20/these-six-crypto-assets-could-rise-10x-this-year-says-trader-lark-davis/,21-05,"Despite the rough crypto markets, trader Lark Davis says six digital assets have the potential to appreciate by ten times or more by the end of the year.Davis kicks off the list with layer-2 decentralized exchange protocol Injective Protocol (INJ) which he argues is currently discounted as its team prepares for launch.“I’m bringing this coin up because it is at a bit of a discount right now. It’s down by about a third in its price from its all-time high. But also injective protocol is going to be going on their mainnet soon.“…and again that current market cap, it’s only $400 million. This could easily be a 10x or more kind of coin. Once that mainnet launches, we start seeing real demand coming in for the token, we start seeing real users coming in, it’s going to be big.”The YouTuber names decentralized exchange QuickSwap (QUICK) as the second digital asset that he believes is set to rally. Davis argues that QuickSwap, which exists on the Polygon network, is currently undervalued.“I think it’s actually an undervalued cryptocurrency right now because the polygon network itself has been going crazy.”Synthetic asset platform Linear Finance (LINA) is third on Davis’s list of digital assets likely to appreciate by ten times. According to Davis, Linear Finance is currently selling at a bargain.“[Linear Finance’s] price is actually down around 77% from its all-time high, which is a pretty dramatic fall in price for something that has been delivering on technology, has users, has been actually you know surviving and building and doing things. It is an irrationally oversold asset right now.”“I think that this has got a lot of room left to grow considering that these big protocols like Synthetix (SNX) have 20x the market cap of what Linear Finance does right now.”The cryptocurrency analyst and trader says decentralized exchange Bancor Network (BNT) is another digital asset with high upside potential. Per Davis, Bancor is a compelling investment as it stands out in the DeFi space.“The product that they’ve delivered is really really cool. So what they’ve been able to solve is the impermanent loss problems. So they allow you to do single-sided liquidity provision with no impermanent loss.“I could even see Bancor again potentially doing a 10x move if the market remains generally bullish throughout the rest of the year.”Non-fungible token (NFT) platform EpiK Protocol (EPK) comes fifth on the list of digital assets likely to rally by over or up to ten times. Davis argues that EpiK Protocol, which is on the verge of conducting a token sale, possesses ‘very high potential’ due to the niche market it is targeting – gaming.“What’s interesting too about EpiK is that there’s not really any direct competitors in the crypto space to what they’re trying to do. They’re tapping specifically into the gaming market working with these massive brands. They’re tapping into a userbase here of a hundred million potential users and gamers.”The YouTuber rounds off the list with Solana blockchain-based DeFi platform Mercurial Finance (MER) which is in the process of undergoing a token sale.“So if you’re looking to get exposure to an early mover in the Solana ecosystem the Mercurial Finance is definitely one to be checking out.”Featured Image: Shutterstock/Art FurnaceCrypto headlines delivered dailyto your inboxBTC, ETH, XRP news alert optionsBy joining The Daily Hodl news list you agree to our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.Check your inbox for confirmation email.

Privacy Coin Monero Rises 30% After Biden Reveals Tax Plans for Crypto Transactions,https://decrypt.co/71616/privacy-coin-monero-rises-30-after-biden-reveals-tax-plans-crypto-transactions/,21-05,"MenuReadingSearchAboutThe price of privacy coin Monero is up. Image: ShutterstockPrivacy coin Monero has increased by 32% in the past day to a price of $316 per coin. The sudden rise in Monero's price comes a day after the U.S. Treasury announced that starting in 2023, crypto transfers above $10,000 should be reported to the tax office.Monero obscures the origins of transactions to preserve its users’ identities. It’s popular among those who use cryptocurrencies on the black market and is the only currency accepted by one of the most popular darknet markets, White House. If the U.S.’s tax office, the Internal Revenue Service, can’t trace Monero transactions, it can’t prosecute anyone who flouts the rules. That logic may have been enough to pump the price of the coin. With a market cap of $5.3 billion, Monero is now the 28th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, things may not be so simple. Blockchain analysis firm Ciphertrace has patented software it claims can trace Monero transactions, and competitor Chainalysis landed a $625,000 contract from the IRS to work out how to trace transactions.Monero is still down roughly 21% in the past week despite the price bump, according to data from Nomics.Like all of the top coins, Monero crashed after three major Chinese bankings and payments firms reiterated that they would not transact with companies that engage in cryptocurrency transactions. The payments giants—National Internet Finance Association of China, China Banking Association, and the Payment and Clearing Association of China—also warned against speculative crypto trading, which “seriously infring[es] on the safety of people's property and disrupt[s] the normal economic and financial order.” Combined with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s criticism of Bitcoin on Twitter, the statements tanked the market. Energy usage trend over past few months is insane https://t.co/E6o9s87trw pic.twitter.com/bmv9wotwKe— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 13, 2021Bitcoin's price fell as low as $30,415 on Wednesday before recovering to its current price of about $40,000. Monero sunk to lows of $198, its lowest price since February. But for now, the coins are back up. Read on the Decrypt App for the best experience.For the best experience, top crypto news at your fingertips and exclusive features download now.MenuSearchAbout"

Bitcoin Plunges 8 Percent as China Calls for Crackdown on Crypto Mining,https://u.today/bitcoin-plunges-8-percent-as-china-calls-for-crackdown-on-crypto-mining,21-05,"China's Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC) has decided to retain its hawkish stance on Bitcoin during its 51st meeting, planning a crackdown on cryptocurrency mining and trading.The Chinese financial regulatory body will also focus on reducing credit risks, reforming medium-sized financial institutions and severely punishing illegal financial activities.The meeting was presided over by China's Vice Premier Liu He.Thomas Heller of Compass Mining claims that local miners are ""unsure"" how the most recent anti-Bitcoin piece of news will affect the industry.Anti-bitcoin (mining) news regularly comes up, but this is worth monitoring. Miners in China I've spoken with are unsure of the impact right now.Bitcoin has plunged to an intraday low of $36,679 on crackdown worries, shedding 12 percent in mere minutes.The FSDC statement marks yet another blow to Bitcoin during its rough week. The cryptocurrency got hammered yesterday after the U.S. Treasury called for transfers over $10,000 to be reported to the IRS by businesses as part of the Biden administration's tax enforcement push.On May 19, Bitcoin plunged to as low as $30,000 during a massive sell-off.Alex Dovbnya (aka AlexMorris) is a cryptocurrency expert, trader and journalist with extensive experience of covering everything related to the burgeoning industry — from price analysis to Blockchain disruption.

The May 19 Sell-Off Actually Strengthened Bitcoin's Narrative,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-volumes-may-19-selloff,22-05,"Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policySign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyPlease consider using a different web browser for better experience.May 19 bitcoin-dollar volumes were the highest so far this year in markets accessible to U.S. investors.May 19 was the worst day bitcoin has seen this year and left some watchers wondering: did it destroy bitcoin’s narrative? The answer is, for those watching closely, it likely strengthened it.  Here’s why: bitcoin proved itself on Wednesday when it saw its second biggest volume day of the year, and market infrastructure did not break. Some exchanges suffered outages, but liquidity was available, as spot volumes show. Moreover, while a drop of over 30% may be dizzying for new buyers high on hopium, such events are not uncommon in bitcoin’s bull-market history.The chart above shows bitcoin-dollar volume on the 11 exchanges that are eligible as components of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX). That means these markets are accessible to U.S. investors, have transparent ownership and do not place limits on bitcoin or dollar withdrawals, among other criteria. The chart shows how the May 19 selloff compared, in bitcoin terms, to volume traded in the Jan. 10 selloff, as Dogecoin and GameStop mania peaked on Jan. 22, and during a second sell-off in February.The bitcoin-dollar markets in general are useful to watch, because they can indicate activity at a well-known market entry point – a place where new entrants “buying the dip” are likely to place orders. More narrowly, XBX eligibility means these exchanges can attract institutional activity as well. In particular, LMAX Digital serves institutional clients exclusively, and Coinbase (marked here as Coinbase Pro) volume is 64% institutional, according to the company’s latest earnings report.(To get insights like this in your inbox every Monday, sign up for CoinDesk Indexes’ weekly newsletter, “The Hard Fork”.)Coinbase specifically set records on Wednesday, handling over $4 billion in notional BTC/USD volume for the first time. (It was not a record in bitcoin units. That record was set Dec. 13 2015, when 165,543 BTC changed hands on Coinbase dollar markets. For context, December 2015 saw bitcoin trading up into the $400s, four months into a bull market that would last through December 2017.) Coinbase ETH/USD markets also handled record volume in both ETH and dollar terms on Wednesday, 1.7 million ETH valued in aggregate at $4.5 billion.  The fact that spot market volume can crescendo like this is an indicator of market maturity, at least in these two blue-chip cryptocurrencies: capital is able to flow in as the price drops, and sellers are finding buyers on the way down. Meanwhile, in offshore derivatives markets, all was normal. Wednesday put this week over $4 billion in bitcoin futures liquidations. As this chart, pulled Thursday from skew.com, shows, this past week was only the third highest week for liquidations so far in 2021, and it’s the fourth time this year that bitcoin futures liquidations have crossed $4 billion in notional value. Offshore futures markets did not artificially flash-crash the price. Wednesday’s bitcoin price drop was swifter and deeper than any so far this year. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) low, struck in the wee hours UTC time at $30,037.61, was 54% off its all-time high, 41% off its price before Elon started tweeting and 30% off the prior day’s closing price at midnight UTC.  It’s the third time this year bitcoin has entered “bear market” territory, by equity markets’ rule of thumb, which is a 20% drop. The two prior occasions occurred as the XBX made its way to its current all-time high ($64,888.19, set on April 14). Some bear market.On any time scale, a 30% intra-day drop is unusual for bitcoin. Matt Weller of forex.com presented this illustrative chart Wednesday afternoon on All About Bitcoin on CoinDesk TV. The chart shows how, in the bull market that began in the second half of 2015, bitcoin saw eight drawdowns of 30% or more. None of them took place in the course of a single 24-hour day. But they all took place during a longer upward trend that took bitcoin’s price from $200 to $20,000.The current bull market dates back to March 2020, when bitcoin hit a yearly low of $3,905. If this bull market grows to resemble that period, it will put bitcoin on course to hit the $400,000 mark by July 2022.

Whale holding $15 billion in Dogecoin bought 420.69 DOGE yesterday,https://cryptoslate.com/whale-holding-15-billion-in-dogecoin-bought-420-69-doge-yesterday/,22-05,"Earn up to 12% APY on Bitcoin, Ethereum, USD, EUR, GBP, Stablecoins & more.Is this what happens when meme lovers end up with billions of dollars?Whoever holds the biggest Dogecoin bag seems to share the memecoin’s sense of humor. They bought up a very small amount of DOGE yesterday in a reference to popular memey culture.DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L, the Dogecoin address which holds an estimated 36.7 billion coins (seemingly accumulating the amount during the crypto bear market of 2019), purchased 420.69 more DOGE on Thursday, blockchain data shows.The purchase cost the whale a paltry $165. But the two numbers are deeply embedded in meme culture: “420” refers to cannabis or to the act of smoking cannabis, while “69” refers to a popular (or unpopular) fornication position.No one knows the exact identity of this “whale”—a colloquial term for the holder of a large supply of a certain cryptocurrency or other assets—but they sit on a $15 billion stack as of today. That’s nearly 30% of Dogecoin’s $51 billion market cap at press time and was worth over $30 billion when DOGE reached its all-time high of $0.73 earlier this month.It could belong to a single person, a group of persons, a crypto exchange (in a cold wallet), or a trading firm, as the ‘whale’ has never publicly come out. Some say it’s unlikely to be a crypto exchange wallet, however, as such wallets have both inflows and outflows of funds (the $15 billion wallet has rarely moved the Dogecoin since accumulating).They do, however, tick two features: The whale is 1. extremely wealthy (who can punt millions of dollars into a meme asset) and 2. Shares a love for or is in line with today’s memes.The above, for some users on the online forum Reddit, points to one person: Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He has both the money and seems to love memes and has incessantly shilled Dogecoin on microblogging site Twitter over the past year.How much is that Doge in the window? pic.twitter.com/bxTkWOr50V— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 20, 2021Musk has previously stated DOGE is bound for the moon, has bought some of the memecoin for his youngest child, and has even accepted Dogecoin as payment for a recent SpaceX mission.He’s not selling the dogecoin either if yesterday’s reply to a tweet is considered. “To clarify, I don’t think Elon would ever sell any of his Doge holdings.  He’s the ultimate hodler,” Dave Lee, a popular Tesla investor on Twitter, said in a tweet yesterday.“Yeah, I haven’t & won’t sell any Doge,” came Musk’s prompt reply a few minutes later.Yeah, I haven’t & won’t sell any Doge— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 20, 2021Whether or not he is the largest holder remains unknown.

Bitcoin (BTC) Miners Might Be Leaving China. Is This Good or Bad?,https://u.today/bitcoin-btc-miners-might-be-leaving-china-is-this-good-or-bad,22-05,"Chinese regulators and watchdogs issued two scary warnings in one week. The Bitcoin (BTC) price plummeted to $30,000, unseen since January. There is some evidence that Chinese Bitcoin (BTC) miners may take these alerts super seriously.Top-notch crypto expert Dovey Wan, founding partner of Primitive Ventures, is sure that the net hashrate of the Bitcoin (BTC) network will expand its dropdown further. It has already lost 30 percent since mid-May and is now estimated at 120 EH/s.While the mid-April dropdown of the Bitcoin (BTC) hashrate was likely attributed to the coal mine explosion in Inner Mongolia province, the ongoing plunge may indicate that miners may start abandoning China.Mrs. Wan admitted that many Chinese miners are preparing to move overseas. For them, the ongoing crackdown on Bitcoin (BTC) mining was foreseen since 2018. So, they are going to relocate mining facilities outside of China.She claims that rigs will mostly be transferred to Pakistan, Kazakhstan and ""other adjacent under-developed countries"" that are traditionally friendly to Chinese entrepreneurs.Also, some Chinese miners are lured by low-cost electricity in Africa and are exploring opportunities to mine Bitcoins (BTC) there, Mrs. Wan added.Meanwhile, such a migration may advance the position of the flagship cryptocurrency. Seasoned Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Vijay Boyapati opines that Bitcoin (BTC) will benefit from its ban in China.Should the Chinese government restrict mining activities, Bitcoin (BTC) entrepreneurs would have to seek opportunities to continue mining in less authoritarian countries.As a result, once the majority of miners move out of China, the traditional ""China FUD"" will finally be dismissed.At the same time, prominent cypherpunk and CEO of Blockstream Bitcoin (BTC) development studio Adam Back is certain that China never ""really"" banned Bitcoin (BTC). Thus, all of these scary alerts are nothing but ""lost in translation"" issues.As covered by U.Today previously, yesterday's anti-Bitcoin (BTC) announcement resulted in a double-digit plunge of the king coin's price. Earlier this week, Bitcoin (BTC) touched $30,000 suppressed by China FUD.However, moving Chinese Bitcoin (BTC) capacities overseas will be a cumbersome and challenging process for mining giants. As a result, mining pools that have already established businesses outside of China might benefit the most from this ""exodus.""Blockchain Analyst & Writer with scientific background. 5+ years in IT-analytics, 2+ years in blockchain.

"Ripple Is Behind Bitcoin Energy Usage FUD, Says Coinshares CSO",https://u.today/ripple-is-behind-bitcoin-energy-usage-fud-says-coinshares-cso,05-23,"Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at Coinshares, is convinced that distributed ledger startup Ripple is behind the now-pervasive anti-Bitcoin narrative that is based on the cryptocurrency’s excessive usage of electricity.

This comes after Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert made an ambiguous remark about a single company allegedly orchestrating the Bitcoin energy usage FUD.Even though CEO Brad Garlinghouse claims that he’s long Bitcoin, the former Yahoo executive has been taking aim at the cryptocurrency’s energy consumption and transaction costs since March 2017 to promote Ripple-affiliated XRP. In his recent CNN interview, he said that one BTC transaction equals 75 gallons of gasoline.       

Ex-Ripple CEO Chris Larsen has displayed even more hostility toward Bitcoin: from making unsubstantiated overblown claims about Bitcoin being potentially destroyed by China to suggesting that the top cryptocurrency should ultimately ditch its proof-of-work consensus protocol to remain relevant.

In its preliminary response to the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Ripple highlighted Bitcoin’s “enormous carbon footprint.”    

In late April, Larsen told Bloomberg that Gary Gensler’s SEC would focus on “green currencies.”

Both Larsen and Ripple CTO David Schwartz harshly criticized a white paper jointly published by Square and Ark Invest, which explains how Bitcoin incentivizes green energy adoption.Demirors says that Ripple has money and it “knows how to play the game.”      The company shelled out $690,000 on its lobbying efforts last year, outspending every other player in the cryptocurrency space. RelatedKey Highlights from Ripple's Latest Discovery Conference with SECAs reported by U.Today, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood said that BlackRock could be behind Tesla’s U-turn on Bitcoin payments: I believe what happened is after he took a position on Bitcoin, he [Elon Musk] got pushback from institutional shareholders like BlackRock. You've got Larry Fink beating the drum on climate change.In early February, BlackRock disclosed ownership of a whopping 50 million Tesla shares, shifting its focus to sustainability.Alex Dovbnya (aka AlexMorris) is a cryptocurrency expert, trader and journalist with extensive experience of covering everything related to the burgeoning industry — from price analysis to Blockchain disruption.

Crypto Market Cap Sinks Below $1.5T as BTC and ETH Continue to Crash,https://decrypt.co/71741/crypto-market-cap-sinks-below-1-5t-as-btc-and-eth-continue-to-crash/,05-23,"MenuReadingSearchAboutVolatility has always been a Bitcoin characteristic.

As the crypto market continues to fall, the market cap of all cryptocurrencies has slipped just below $1.5 trillion, according to data from metrics site Nomics.This marks a 9% decrease in the past 24 hours, a 35% decrease in the past week, and a sharp decline from all-time highs of about $2.5 trillion achieved close to the start of the month. A 9% overnight crash knocked a further 7% off of the price of Bitcoin, which is now worth about $35,000. The dip also lopped 13% off of Ethereum, now priced at $2,073—less than half its all-time high of $4,165 achieved on May 11. Smaller altcoins fared even worse. Binance Coin (BNB) is down 18% in the past 24 hours. At a price of $257 and a market cap of $39 billion, it has slipped two positions in the rankings to become the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin gladly took its place, even though they fell by 14% and 9% overnight, respectively. A string of bad news is behind the crash. The damage started on May 12, when Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, retraced his support for Bitcoin and announced that Telsa would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin. Tesla & Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2021Tesla had bought $1.5 billion in Bitcoin in January, and the purchase signaled to retail investors that the coin could be worth taking seriously. After all, Musk is among the richest people in the world—surely he knows how to spend his money. It turns out that Musk did not know what he was getting into; he spent the past week trashing the coin and undermining its biggest supporters. Musk cited issues with Bitcoin’s energy-intensive proof-of-work mining mechanism, and the concentration of miners in China.Several top cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and Huobi suffered outages when the price of Bitcoin crashed; some, such as Binance and Huobi, temporarily suspended withdrawals of Ethereum tokens. Some of our fiat channel partners can't handle the load on their side now. But they are very excited about the growth in users we brought to them. haha. Sorry for the inconvenience though. Working on it.— CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) May 19, 2021More price-pummelling followed on Wednesday when three prominent Chinese financial institutions reiterated their support for a 2017 ban that prevented them from transacting with customers who dealt with crypto. The institutions also warned that cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and speculative investments that can destabilize the “normal economic and financial order.”The next blow came when China’s financial committee added cryptocurrency mining to a list of industries that ought to be monitored to “prevent and control financial risks.” The announcement sparked concerns of a crackdown on Bitcoin mining. A study published in Nature last month, citing data from BTC.com, found that China accounts for approximately 70% of the world’s Bitcoin mining. The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.Read on the Decrypt App for the best experience.For the best experience, top crypto news at your fingertips and exclusive features download now.MenuSearchAbout"
