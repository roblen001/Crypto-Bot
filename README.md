This is the front end portion of the reinforcement learning trading agent project found here: https://github.com/roblen001/reinforcement_learning_trading_agent

I am currently in the process of organizing the project and adding the reinforcement learning agent to the back end. The intent is for the flask-api folder to run on a raspberry pi 24/7 to scrape news data as well as allow the agent to trade non stop. The front end which can be ran with “gatsby develop” allows me to see how the bot is currently trading. 

I will be able to organize the project in the coming months and create a proper README file.
