Buy signal for two oversold cryptocurrencies this week,https://finbold.com/buy-signal-for-two-oversold-cryptocurrencies-this-week/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,22-06,"The cryptocurrency market remains in a state of flux, with the global market cap hovering around $2.47 trillion, reflecting a modest 0.8% change in the past 24 hours. Trading volume has surged to $48.8 billion, indicating high investor activity and interest. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) dominate the market, with 51.3% and 17.3% shares, respectively. Despite this bustling activity, the overall market’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 34.76, signaling that many assets are potentially oversold.This presents an opportunity for savvy investors to identify undervalued cryptocurrencies with the potential for a short-term rebound (within this week). From an optimistic perspective, Finbold identified two cryptocurrencies that are notably oversold on a short-term basis, as evidenced by their RSI readings, according to data from CoinGlass. Avalanche (AVAX) shows several factors that could make it an attractive buy. The 24-hour RSI for AVAX is 29.33, placing it in oversold territory. Historically, assets with such low RSI tend to experience price corrections. However, oversold conditions don’t guarantee a rebound, and the market may stay oversold for extended periods.Additionally, AVAX has experienced a 4.7% decrease in price over the past 24 hours, suggesting a recent sell-off that might be an overreaction by the market. This dip presents a potential entry point for investors looking to capitalize on the subsequent price recovery. Supporting the buy signal, AVAX’s momentum indicator is currently showing a buy signal, reflecting positive momentum despite the oversold condition. The Williams Percent Range, another momentum indicator, also supports a buy, indicating that AVAX is currently oversold.Despite the strong sell signals from moving averages, which reflect the recent downward trend, the oversold RSI and positive momentum indicators highlight the potential for a bullish reversal.The average market RSI of 34.76 further emphasizes that AVAX is more oversold compared to the broader market, enhancing the potential for a rebound.Starknet (STRK)  presents several buy signals based on its RSI and additional technical indicators. Both the 24-hour and 12-hour RSI values for STRK are well below 30, standing at 26 and 26.48, respectively, indicating strong oversold conditions. This makes STRK a prime candidate for a potential price rebound.Unlike AVAX, STRK has experienced a positive price change of 0.98% over the past 24 hours. This positive momentum, despite the oversold RSI, suggests that the market is beginning to recognize its undervaluation, which could lead to further price increases. Further supporting the buy signal for STRK are the Williams Percent Range indicators. The Williams Percent Range, with a value of -88.235, shows that STRK is heavily oversold, reinforcing the potential for a price increase.Despite the sell signals from various moving averages, these oversold indicators suggest a high potential for an upward correction. The average market RSI of 34.76 highlights that STRK is significantly more oversold compared to the broader market, enhancing the likelihood of a rebound.For investors and traders looking for buy opportunities this week, AVAX and STRK present interesting cases based on their current RSI values and recent price movements. However, it’s crucial to remember the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, where market conditions can rapidly changeDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

The Visionary Behind Uniswap: Journey of Hayden Adams,https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/the-visionary-behind-uniswap-journey-of-hayden-adams/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,22-06,"Hayden Adams was facing a decision in 2017. After being fired recently from Siemens, where he worked on design exploration for clients in the aerospace and automotive sectors, Adams was thinking about what to do next. It was during this unsettling time that Karl Floersch, a friend, first exposed him to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.This introduction would significantly alter Adams’ career and contribute to the development of Uniswap, one of the most potent decentralized exchanges (DEX) in the world.Learning to code was the first step Adams took in entering the crypto world. Adams started playing with Ethereum and learning JavaScript and Solidity thanks to Floersch, an employee of the Ethereum Foundation. Although his early initiatives were modest, they gave him invaluable expertise that would be essential in the future to the creation of Uniswap.Adams debuted Uniswap in November of 2018. A special automated market maker (AMM) mechanism that the platform provides enables users to trade cryptocurrencies straight from their wallets without the involvement of centralised middlemen.This invention addressed the two main issues with the cryptocurrency exchange market: fragmentation of liquidity and decentralization.Because they used centralised order books and intermediaries, traditional exchanges were opaque and inaccessible. Smart contract-powered Uniswap’s AMM approach produced liquidity pools where users could easily trade ERC-20 tokens.It was no mean achievement to launch Uniswap. Adams devoted many hours coding, frequently working in his office through the night. When the Ethereum Foundation awarded him $65,000 to audit the project’s code, his commitment paid off, as he was able to complete a thorough audit and enhance the platform.Even with these early triumphs, Adams had to overcome formidable obstacles, including technological difficulties and regulatory scrutiny. But his tenacity and creative thinking allowed Uniswap to overcome these challenges and become quite popular in the DeFi market.The May 2021 release of Uniswap V3 was one of the platform’s significant turning points. Through the introduction of ground-breaking features, including various fee levels and concentrated liquidity, this upgrade improved the efficiency and flexibility of the platform.Uniswap’s standing as a top DEX was cemented when these enhancements attracted traders and liquidity providers even more.As the CEO of Uniswap, Adams has been instrumental in determining the strategic orientation of the platform. His forward-thinking strategy has made sure that Uniswap stays at the vanguard of the DeFi revolution. The Uniswap community feels ownership and involvement from Adams’ leadership style, which makes users active participants in the platform’s expansion.Adams has also played a key role in establishing alliances and joint ventures that have increased the size and impact of Uniswap. With his direction, Uniswap has partnered with other well-known initiatives and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem, which has helped decentralized finance expand generally.Uniswap has had a significant impact on DeFi. easy-to-use interface and creative AMM model of the platform have made cryptocurrency trading more accessible and given liquidity providers new ways to make passive money.Due in large part to Uniswap’s success, the DeFi industry has expanded and become an essential component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Apart from its technological accomplishments, Uniswap has been a major factor in the emergence of DeFi, which has helped to popularize decentralized banking. In the field of cryptocurrencies, the platform’s daily trading volumes frequently exceed those of large centralized exchanges.Adams and the Uniswap team are still hard at work creating fresh functionality and apps for the platform. Uniswap Labs established Uniswap Labs Ventures in 2024 as a venture capital firm to assist web3 initiatives and participate in governance mechanisms.Adams is dedicated to assisting the larger blockchain ecosystem and promoting innovation in the DeFi field, as this project demonstrates.Adams is still concentrating on increasing the scalability and user experience of Uniswap as DeFi develops. He sees a day when Uniswap is the preferred decentralized marketplace for buying and selling digital assets. With intentions to provide additional functionality and improve user experience, Adams is well-positioned to lead Uniswap to even bigger success.Adams has achieved much in his career, but his personal path also demonstrates his tenacity and commitment. Adams’ tale of tenacity and creativity spans his early years as a mechanical engineer to his rise to prominence in the DeFi field. His experiences have moulded both his leadership style and his outlook on the direction of finance.Additionally, Adams is a social media user who offers his thoughts and views on the situation of financial institutions and the possibilities of blockchain technology. In the cryptocurrency sector, he is well-liked for his candour and readiness to interact with the community.Hayden Adams is well-known and much admired for his contributions to the DeFi field. His work on Uniswap has improved the accessibility and usability of the decentralized financial ecosystem for a worldwide audience.          No spam, no lies, only insights.

                            It was learned that the hacker, who stole an undetermined amount of crypto assets from the Turkish cryptocurrency exchange BTCTurk, made another attack on another platform.According to a new statement made by cryptocurrency detective ZachXBT, the hacker who stole an undisclosed amount of assets from BTCTurk hacked another cryptocurrency platform called Sportsbet and stole more than $ 2.9 million in assets from there.The assets stolen in the two hacking incidents were thus mixed.BtcTurk had assured users that its financial flexibility exceeded the affected amounts.Meanwhile, the previous hack coincided with a significant 10% drop in the Avalanche (AVAX) token. ZachXBT reported that approximately 1.96 million AVAX tokens worth $54.2 million were transferred to various exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Gate, and significantly via THORChain.*This is not investment advice.ΔΔCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

Bitcoin's next impulse could send BTC to $100K in 30 days,https://finbold.com/bitcoins-next-impulse-could-send-btc-to-100k-in-30-days/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,22-06,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a four-month consolidation range since February 28, which has brought uncertainty to investors. However, a prominent trader, Credible Crypto, believes Bitcoin could reach $100,000 in 30 days after the next impulse starts.The professional analyst, who now goes by CrediBULL Crypto due to his current bullish bias, still foresees a bright future. According to a recent post on X, the trader doubled down on his positive outlook, making a bold price prediction.In particular, he highlighted Bitcoin’s previous impulse, which sent the leading cryptocurrency‘s price from $38,514 to $73,805. Notably, this first impulse lasted 50 days, with 91% gains accrued from January 23 to March 13.“The impulses that follow should be even more aggressive, and we are trading at 64k. Our next impulse could send us to 100k within 30 days, and we still have around 6 months left till EOY.”Credible Crypto‘s forecast is based on the Elliott Waves theory, which is popular among technical analysts in trend analyses. The theory says that a bull market is made of five waves, of which three are “impulse” waves. Usually, the third wave is the most aggressive, making for higher gains in a shorter time frame.With Bitcoin trading at $64,260, a rally to $100,000 would result in 55% gains, lower than expected. However, the “$100K” level marks an important psychological resistance and a target that many investors look forward to reaching. This could create selling pressure in this price zone, slowing down the third wave.Interestingly, competing traders have already planned their exit strategy, eyeing the $130,000 level as an initial target. Others, like Alan Santana, believe in an uptrend continuation to $150,000 per BTC.On the other hand, Bitcoin has shown signals of weakness from a fundamental perspective. For example, miners have been capitulating, selling at a higher pace after years of operating underwater. Therefore, these analysts’ projections will depend on positive developments and fundamental improvements for the leading cryptocurrency that faces strong competition.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Ethereum or Silver? We asked ChatGPT-4o which asset is a better investment for 2024,https://finbold.com/ethereum-or-silver-we-asked-chatgpt-4o-which-asset-is-a-better-investment-for-2024/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,22-06,"As the broader cryptocurrency market faces a downturn, Ethereum (ETH) has demonstrated notable resilience, maintaining its value above $3,400. At the same time, silver (XAG/USD) is holding firm at a key support level of $29.00, rebounding as US bond yields come under pressure.The evolving economic environment has led investors to reevaluate their strategies, comparing the benefits of Ethereum as a leading digital asset with the crucial role of silver in emerging technologies and its responsiveness to industrial demand fluctuations.Ethereum’s potential for aggressive growth and high volatility makes it an appealing speculative investment. Its foundational role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and smart contract functionality offers significant upside potential. Additionally, Ethereum’s continuous technological advancements, such as the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and growing institutional interest, add to its attractiveness as a high-reward investment. Standard Chartered, an international banking giant, recently announced plans to open a trading desk for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, enhancing Ethereum’s market presence. Ethereum’s flexibility and innovation within blockchain technology provide a hedge against traditional financial market instability and inflation, positioning it as a forward-looking investment choice.Silver, on the other hand, provides stability and growth potential tied to emerging technologies and global sustainability trends. Unlike Ethereum, silver is less volatile and benefits from its dual role as both an investment and an industrial commodity. Its sensitivity to industrial demand cycles and use in high-tech solutions position it for steady appreciation. Silver’s traditional role as a hedge against inflation and economic downturns makes it a reliable choice for more conservative investors.According to ChatGPT-4o, the decision largely depends on individual investment strategies and risk tolerance.Investors looking at Ethereum should be comfortable with higher risks and the potential for high rewards. This includes tech enthusiasts captivated by blockchain innovations, long-term believers in the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, and institutional investors seeking advanced digital assets. Ethereum’s recent resilience, growing user engagement, and potential ETF approvals make it a compelling choice for those aiming for significant growth.On the other hand, silver suits conservative investors who prioritize stability and steady growth. Silver’s extensive use in electronics, solar panels, and medical devices ensures ongoing demand, making it a reliable industrial commodity. Additionally, silver serves as a traditional hedge against inflation and economic downturns, appealing to those who prefer tangible, physical assets. Its role as both an investment and an industrial commodity makes silver a sound choice for those seeking a balanced and secure addition to their portfolios.Ultimately, diversification with both Ethereum and silver can be a way to manage risk and potentially benefit from the growth of both major assets. The choice between Ethereum and silver should align with individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and interest in the technological aspects of cryptocurrencies.As of 2024, six months performance for Ethereum and silver presents a clear contrast in investment returns. Ethereum has seen a significant rise, with an increase of 39% in six months, showcasing its volatile yet high-growth nature with its current price at $3,505.In comparison, silver has gained 30% in six months, with its current price at about $29.5 per ounce.In conclusion, both Ethereum and silver offer unique investment opportunities suited to different risk profiles and market perspectives.Ethereum’s innovative edge and high-growth potential make it an attractive option for those willing to embrace volatility and technological advancements. In contrast, silver’s stability and industrial applications provide a safer, more conservative investment route. Diversifying with both assets could offer a balanced approach, allowing investors to capitalize on the strengths of each while mitigating overall risk.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.
