Buy signal for two oversold cryptocurrencies this week,https://finbold.com/buy-signal-for-two-oversold-cryptocurrencies-this-week/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,22-06,"The cryptocurrency market remains in a state of flux, with the global market cap hovering around $2.47 trillion, reflecting a modest 0.8% change in the past 24 hours. Trading volume has surged to $48.8 billion, indicating high investor activity and interest. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) dominate the market, with 51.3% and 17.3% shares, respectively. Despite this bustling activity, the overall market’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 34.76, signaling that many assets are potentially oversold.This presents an opportunity for savvy investors to identify undervalued cryptocurrencies with the potential for a short-term rebound (within this week). From an optimistic perspective, Finbold identified two cryptocurrencies that are notably oversold on a short-term basis, as evidenced by their RSI readings, according to data from CoinGlass. Avalanche (AVAX) shows several factors that could make it an attractive buy. The 24-hour RSI for AVAX is 29.33, placing it in oversold territory. Historically, assets with such low RSI tend to experience price corrections. However, oversold conditions don’t guarantee a rebound, and the market may stay oversold for extended periods.Additionally, AVAX has experienced a 4.7% decrease in price over the past 24 hours, suggesting a recent sell-off that might be an overreaction by the market. This dip presents a potential entry point for investors looking to capitalize on the subsequent price recovery. Supporting the buy signal, AVAX’s momentum indicator is currently showing a buy signal, reflecting positive momentum despite the oversold condition. The Williams Percent Range, another momentum indicator, also supports a buy, indicating that AVAX is currently oversold.Despite the strong sell signals from moving averages, which reflect the recent downward trend, the oversold RSI and positive momentum indicators highlight the potential for a bullish reversal.The average market RSI of 34.76 further emphasizes that AVAX is more oversold compared to the broader market, enhancing the potential for a rebound.Starknet (STRK)  presents several buy signals based on its RSI and additional technical indicators. Both the 24-hour and 12-hour RSI values for STRK are well below 30, standing at 26 and 26.48, respectively, indicating strong oversold conditions. This makes STRK a prime candidate for a potential price rebound.Unlike AVAX, STRK has experienced a positive price change of 0.98% over the past 24 hours. This positive momentum, despite the oversold RSI, suggests that the market is beginning to recognize its undervaluation, which could lead to further price increases. Further supporting the buy signal for STRK are the Williams Percent Range indicators. The Williams Percent Range, with a value of -88.235, shows that STRK is heavily oversold, reinforcing the potential for a price increase.Despite the sell signals from various moving averages, these oversold indicators suggest a high potential for an upward correction. The average market RSI of 34.76 highlights that STRK is significantly more oversold compared to the broader market, enhancing the likelihood of a rebound.For investors and traders looking for buy opportunities this week, AVAX and STRK present interesting cases based on their current RSI values and recent price movements. However, it’s crucial to remember the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, where market conditions can rapidly changeDisclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

The Visionary Behind Uniswap: Journey of Hayden Adams,https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/the-visionary-behind-uniswap-journey-of-hayden-adams/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,22-06,"Hayden Adams was facing a decision in 2017. After being fired recently from Siemens, where he worked on design exploration for clients in the aerospace and automotive sectors, Adams was thinking about what to do next. It was during this unsettling time that Karl Floersch, a friend, first exposed him to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.This introduction would significantly alter Adams’ career and contribute to the development of Uniswap, one of the most potent decentralized exchanges (DEX) in the world.Learning to code was the first step Adams took in entering the crypto world. Adams started playing with Ethereum and learning JavaScript and Solidity thanks to Floersch, an employee of the Ethereum Foundation. Although his early initiatives were modest, they gave him invaluable expertise that would be essential in the future to the creation of Uniswap.Adams debuted Uniswap in November of 2018. A special automated market maker (AMM) mechanism that the platform provides enables users to trade cryptocurrencies straight from their wallets without the involvement of centralised middlemen.This invention addressed the two main issues with the cryptocurrency exchange market: fragmentation of liquidity and decentralization.Because they used centralised order books and intermediaries, traditional exchanges were opaque and inaccessible. Smart contract-powered Uniswap’s AMM approach produced liquidity pools where users could easily trade ERC-20 tokens.It was no mean achievement to launch Uniswap. Adams devoted many hours coding, frequently working in his office through the night. When the Ethereum Foundation awarded him $65,000 to audit the project’s code, his commitment paid off, as he was able to complete a thorough audit and enhance the platform.Even with these early triumphs, Adams had to overcome formidable obstacles, including technological difficulties and regulatory scrutiny. But his tenacity and creative thinking allowed Uniswap to overcome these challenges and become quite popular in the DeFi market.The May 2021 release of Uniswap V3 was one of the platform’s significant turning points. Through the introduction of ground-breaking features, including various fee levels and concentrated liquidity, this upgrade improved the efficiency and flexibility of the platform.Uniswap’s standing as a top DEX was cemented when these enhancements attracted traders and liquidity providers even more.As the CEO of Uniswap, Adams has been instrumental in determining the strategic orientation of the platform. His forward-thinking strategy has made sure that Uniswap stays at the vanguard of the DeFi revolution. The Uniswap community feels ownership and involvement from Adams’ leadership style, which makes users active participants in the platform’s expansion.Adams has also played a key role in establishing alliances and joint ventures that have increased the size and impact of Uniswap. With his direction, Uniswap has partnered with other well-known initiatives and platforms in the DeFi ecosystem, which has helped decentralized finance expand generally.Uniswap has had a significant impact on DeFi. easy-to-use interface and creative AMM model of the platform have made cryptocurrency trading more accessible and given liquidity providers new ways to make passive money.Due in large part to Uniswap’s success, the DeFi industry has expanded and become an essential component of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.Apart from its technological accomplishments, Uniswap has been a major factor in the emergence of DeFi, which has helped to popularize decentralized banking. In the field of cryptocurrencies, the platform’s daily trading volumes frequently exceed those of large centralized exchanges.Adams and the Uniswap team are still hard at work creating fresh functionality and apps for the platform. Uniswap Labs established Uniswap Labs Ventures in 2024 as a venture capital firm to assist web3 initiatives and participate in governance mechanisms.Adams is dedicated to assisting the larger blockchain ecosystem and promoting innovation in the DeFi field, as this project demonstrates.Adams is still concentrating on increasing the scalability and user experience of Uniswap as DeFi develops. He sees a day when Uniswap is the preferred decentralized marketplace for buying and selling digital assets. With intentions to provide additional functionality and improve user experience, Adams is well-positioned to lead Uniswap to even bigger success.Adams has achieved much in his career, but his personal path also demonstrates his tenacity and commitment. Adams’ tale of tenacity and creativity spans his early years as a mechanical engineer to his rise to prominence in the DeFi field. His experiences have moulded both his leadership style and his outlook on the direction of finance.Additionally, Adams is a social media user who offers his thoughts and views on the situation of financial institutions and the possibilities of blockchain technology. In the cryptocurrency sector, he is well-liked for his candour and readiness to interact with the community.Hayden Adams is well-known and much admired for his contributions to the DeFi field. His work on Uniswap has improved the accessibility and usability of the decentralized financial ecosystem for a worldwide audience.          No spam, no lies, only insights.

                            It was learned that the hacker, who stole an undetermined amount of crypto assets from the Turkish cryptocurrency exchange BTCTurk, made another attack on another platform.According to a new statement made by cryptocurrency detective ZachXBT, the hacker who stole an undisclosed amount of assets from BTCTurk hacked another cryptocurrency platform called Sportsbet and stole more than $ 2.9 million in assets from there.The assets stolen in the two hacking incidents were thus mixed.BtcTurk had assured users that its financial flexibility exceeded the affected amounts.Meanwhile, the previous hack coincided with a significant 10% drop in the Avalanche (AVAX) token. ZachXBT reported that approximately 1.96 million AVAX tokens worth $54.2 million were transferred to various exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Gate, and significantly via THORChain.*This is not investment advice.ΔΔCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

Bitcoin's next impulse could send BTC to $100K in 30 days,https://finbold.com/bitcoins-next-impulse-could-send-btc-to-100k-in-30-days/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,22-06,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a four-month consolidation range since February 28, which has brought uncertainty to investors. However, a prominent trader, Credible Crypto, believes Bitcoin could reach $100,000 in 30 days after the next impulse starts.The professional analyst, who now goes by CrediBULL Crypto due to his current bullish bias, still foresees a bright future. According to a recent post on X, the trader doubled down on his positive outlook, making a bold price prediction.In particular, he highlighted Bitcoin’s previous impulse, which sent the leading cryptocurrency‘s price from $38,514 to $73,805. Notably, this first impulse lasted 50 days, with 91% gains accrued from January 23 to March 13.“The impulses that follow should be even more aggressive, and we are trading at 64k. Our next impulse could send us to 100k within 30 days, and we still have around 6 months left till EOY.”Credible Crypto‘s forecast is based on the Elliott Waves theory, which is popular among technical analysts in trend analyses. The theory says that a bull market is made of five waves, of which three are “impulse” waves. Usually, the third wave is the most aggressive, making for higher gains in a shorter time frame.With Bitcoin trading at $64,260, a rally to $100,000 would result in 55% gains, lower than expected. However, the “$100K” level marks an important psychological resistance and a target that many investors look forward to reaching. This could create selling pressure in this price zone, slowing down the third wave.Interestingly, competing traders have already planned their exit strategy, eyeing the $130,000 level as an initial target. Others, like Alan Santana, believe in an uptrend continuation to $150,000 per BTC.On the other hand, Bitcoin has shown signals of weakness from a fundamental perspective. For example, miners have been capitulating, selling at a higher pace after years of operating underwater. Therefore, these analysts’ projections will depend on positive developments and fundamental improvements for the leading cryptocurrency that faces strong competition.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Ethereum or Silver? We asked ChatGPT-4o which asset is a better investment for 2024,https://finbold.com/ethereum-or-silver-we-asked-chatgpt-4o-which-asset-is-a-better-investment-for-2024/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,22-06,"As the broader cryptocurrency market faces a downturn, Ethereum (ETH) has demonstrated notable resilience, maintaining its value above $3,400. At the same time, silver (XAG/USD) is holding firm at a key support level of $29.00, rebounding as US bond yields come under pressure.The evolving economic environment has led investors to reevaluate their strategies, comparing the benefits of Ethereum as a leading digital asset with the crucial role of silver in emerging technologies and its responsiveness to industrial demand fluctuations.Ethereum’s potential for aggressive growth and high volatility makes it an appealing speculative investment. Its foundational role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and smart contract functionality offers significant upside potential. Additionally, Ethereum’s continuous technological advancements, such as the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and growing institutional interest, add to its attractiveness as a high-reward investment. Standard Chartered, an international banking giant, recently announced plans to open a trading desk for spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, enhancing Ethereum’s market presence. Ethereum’s flexibility and innovation within blockchain technology provide a hedge against traditional financial market instability and inflation, positioning it as a forward-looking investment choice.Silver, on the other hand, provides stability and growth potential tied to emerging technologies and global sustainability trends. Unlike Ethereum, silver is less volatile and benefits from its dual role as both an investment and an industrial commodity. Its sensitivity to industrial demand cycles and use in high-tech solutions position it for steady appreciation. Silver’s traditional role as a hedge against inflation and economic downturns makes it a reliable choice for more conservative investors.According to ChatGPT-4o, the decision largely depends on individual investment strategies and risk tolerance.Investors looking at Ethereum should be comfortable with higher risks and the potential for high rewards. This includes tech enthusiasts captivated by blockchain innovations, long-term believers in the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, and institutional investors seeking advanced digital assets. Ethereum’s recent resilience, growing user engagement, and potential ETF approvals make it a compelling choice for those aiming for significant growth.On the other hand, silver suits conservative investors who prioritize stability and steady growth. Silver’s extensive use in electronics, solar panels, and medical devices ensures ongoing demand, making it a reliable industrial commodity. Additionally, silver serves as a traditional hedge against inflation and economic downturns, appealing to those who prefer tangible, physical assets. Its role as both an investment and an industrial commodity makes silver a sound choice for those seeking a balanced and secure addition to their portfolios.Ultimately, diversification with both Ethereum and silver can be a way to manage risk and potentially benefit from the growth of both major assets. The choice between Ethereum and silver should align with individual investment goals, risk tolerance, and interest in the technological aspects of cryptocurrencies.As of 2024, six months performance for Ethereum and silver presents a clear contrast in investment returns. Ethereum has seen a significant rise, with an increase of 39% in six months, showcasing its volatile yet high-growth nature with its current price at $3,505.In comparison, silver has gained 30% in six months, with its current price at about $29.5 per ounce.In conclusion, both Ethereum and silver offer unique investment opportunities suited to different risk profiles and market perspectives.Ethereum’s innovative edge and high-growth potential make it an attractive option for those willing to embrace volatility and technological advancements. In contrast, silver’s stability and industrial applications provide a safer, more conservative investment route. Diversifying with both assets could offer a balanced approach, allowing investors to capitalize on the strengths of each while mitigating overall risk.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

2 cryptocurrencies to reach $50 billion market cap in July,https://finbold.com/2-cryptocurrencies-to-reach-50-billion-market-cap-in-july/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,32 m-,"Despite recent downturns in the cryptocurrency market, several digital assets show strong potential for significant growth in the coming months. As the global cryptocurrency market cap stands at $2.4 trillion with a 2.9% increase in the last 24 hours, certain cryptocurrencies present promising investment opportunities. Finbold has identified two digital assets likely to reach a market cap of $50 billion by the end of July.XRP  has been navigating through a challenging phase, particularly with its price consolidating below the $1 mark. Currently priced at $0.4771, XRP has faced resistance at the $0.4820 level, resulting in declines below $0.4750. However, the asset has shown resilience, rebounding from a low of $0.4619. With recent upward moves clearing the $0.4680 and $0.4720 resistance levels, XRP is recovering and gaining traction. The ongoing legal dispute with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains a significant hurdle, but Ripple’s intensified focus on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) could strengthen its market position and drive future growth.Additionally, XRP saw $0.7 million in investments in a week, indicating growing investor confidence. If the broader cryptocurrency market continues to recover and Ripple makes progress in its legal battle, XRP’s market cap, currently at $26.5 billion, could surge toward $50 billion.Toncoin (TON), on the other hand, has experienced notable price fluctuations recently, reaching a new high of $8.31 before stabilizing around $7.60. Priced at $7.49, TON has shown resilience despite a sharp downturn.TON has formed an ascending triangle pattern with horizontal resistance at $7.50. The recent breakout to a new high suggests potential for a bullish uptrend, targeting $10 in the short term and possibly pushing beyond in subsequent rallies. If TON can sustain its upward momentum and break through its current resistance levels, its market cap, now at $18.4 billion, could also reach $50 billion by July. The overall market conditions, including increased trading volume and broader market recovery, will play a crucial role in achieving this milestone.Both XRP and TON demonstrate strong growth potential, making them attractive investment options for July. XRP’s recovery efforts, coupled with Ripple’s strategic focus on CBDCs and TON’s technical resilience, suggest that these cryptocurrencies are on track to achieve significant market cap milestones.For traders and investors looking for promising assets, XRP and TON are worth considering as they navigate the path towards a $50 billion market cap.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

He has previous trading experience and has been working in the Fintech industry since 2017.10X Research suggests Bitcoin could plummet to $50,000 due to declining liquidity.Analysts warn of a ""double-top"" pattern, predicting a possible drop to $45,000.Increased fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) contribute to market volatility and potential shakeouts.Bitcoin’s recent drop in price has taken it back to levels we last saw after the April halving, sitting around $58,560. This decline has sparked new talks among analysts and investors about what’s next for the top cryptocurrency. Currently bitcoin is struggling to break higher resistance levels, and some experts are noticing a pattern called a “double-top,” indicating a potential drop to $50,000.According to insights from 10X Research, a trusted on-chain analytics firm, warning that Bitcoin is entering a critical phase marked by declining liquidity and growing market uncertainty.https://t.co/adUbMPLuL6However, the firm’s analysis presents a concerning possibility, as Bitcoin’s price could plummet to $50,000 or even lower, with $45,000 as a plausible target. Analysts are advising investors to be careful about a “double top” pattern, which often comes before a big price drop. The emergence of this pattern suggests that Bitcoin might have reached its highest point and could be in for a bigger fall soon. Furthermore, the analysts also point out that as Bitcoin struggles, there’s less money being traded overall. And it’s not just Bitcoin; similar warnings about Ethereum and Solana have proven to be right recently, showing that it’s a cautious time for all digital assets.Echoing a similar bearish stance prominent crypto trader Jelle drew parallels between the current state of Bitcoin and its behavior during the 2016-2017 cycle. According to Jelle, Bitcoin is showing similar patterns of consolidation around previous cycle highs, suggesting a period of uncertainty and choppy price movement.#Bitcoin is still playing out similarly to 2016-2017 — chopping around the previous cycle highs.More and more fud is being offloaded at current prices, adding to the shakeout effects.Either it's very over, or we're close to a bottom.I'm betting on the latter. pic.twitter.com/NqDfUzEvz8Moreover, Jelle noted an increase in fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) being circulated at current price levels, contributing to market volatility and shakeout effects.

Is Bitcoin volume dying out? Weekend trading hits rock bottom,https://finbold.com/is-bitcoin-volume-dying-out-weekend-trading-hits-rock-bottom/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,25-06,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekend share of trading volume has reached an all-time low in 2024, with a trending dominance of weekdays. This trend highlights an important shift for the leading cryptocurrency, approaching the traditional finance market behavior as institutions take over.This data was recently highlighted in a Kaiko report comparing the trading volume on weekends to weekdays. Notably, Bitcoin registered a 16% share of the trading volume during the weekends from January to June. This marks an all-time low for the same period, with Kaiko looking at data from seven BTC pairs since 2012.Previously, higher lows were in 2022 and 2013, both with 19% of the overall trading volume happening on weekends. Moreover, there has been a notable downtrend since 2019’s 28% peak, with weekend volume making lower highs every two years.The report suggests Bitcoin spot ETFs could be partially blamed for the record lows, driving the action to weekdays. These financial products operate under traditional finance rules, so they are limited to Wall Street’s weekday operations, no different from stocks and other exchange-traded funds.Interestingly, the weekend share downtrend is just one piece of the puzzle that shows Bitcoin’s changing behavior.The leading cryptocurrency once started in a small community of cypherpunks, following a vision of being an electronic peer-to-peer cash system whose core value was based on the non-reliance of intermediaries to fix the issues within traditional finance. A financial system that never sleeps and an asset that its users could do self-custody and avoid the monetary debasement from inflation and fractional reserves.However, the market has seen diminishing on-chain and spot trading volumes. Conversely, derivatives and ETF volumes have been increasing in the opposite direction of the first two, challenging the original vision. Finbold reported the aforementioned divergence on June 2.According to data gathered from Santiment’s SanBase Pro on June 25, the scenario remains the same by press time. BTC trades in a price range, currently at $61,400, while trading and transaction volumes make lower highs.Furthermore, a significant part of this volume is made inside centralized databases from crypto exchanges, not using the blockchain. For example, a report from Altcoinbuzz highlighted how BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) can supposedly borrow Bitcoin from Coinbase without providing a 1:1 holding ratio, which could suggest the use of what the market calls “paper bitcoin,” potentially allowing unbacked short-selling. You read it right: BlackRock has been settling its BTC transactions with Coinbase without using Bitcoin's settlement network.We are not talking about ""buying a coffee,"" but institutional settlements of a $18.5 billion fund.The reason: Transaction speed and fees.Got it now?… pic.twitter.com/SxzAcHyzlJOnly time will tell whether these changes could positively or negatively affect the price of Bitcoin in the long run. Right now, it is clear that BTC is going through a behavior change, and investors must evaluate these changes to make decisions accordingly.Best Crypto Exchange for Intermediate Traders and Investors

Bitcoin veterans account for 40% of profit-taking despite low trading volume,https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-profit-trends-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,25-06,"Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin (BTC) long-term holders (LTHs) are the investors with the most profit-taking and less trading activity in crypto currently, according to the latest “The Week On-chain” report by Glassnode. Despite their daily on-chain volume of 4% to 8%, the LTH represents up to 40% of the profit-taking movements.“Whilst there are occasional bursts of spending activity for each cohort, the frequency of high-spending days increases dramatically during the euphoria phase of a bull market,” the report points out. “This highlights the relatively consistent behavior pattern of long-term investors taking profits during periods of rapid price appreciation.”This behavior underscores the substantial impact of long-term holders on market liquidity and price stability. During periods of market euphoria, LTHs’ selling activity tends to increase, aligning with substantial price appreciations and contributing to the cyclical nature of the market.Notably, Glassnode analysts highlighted that the current BTC price is below the cost basis of both the holders from one week to one month (1w-1m holders) and one month to three months (1m-3m holders), which are $68,500 and $66,400, respectively. Therefore, if the price stays below those levels for too long, history suggests that investor confidence will deteriorate and result in deeper corrections.Moreover, when the cost basis of the 1w-1m holders falls below the 1m-3m cost basis, the structure formed by this movement signals “a diminishing momentum in the demand side,” ending up on net capital outflows from Bitcoin. The image below shows that this outflow movement happened five times in the bull cycles witnessed in 2017 and 2021, and is currently in its fourth instance in the current cycle.Additionally, the current consolidation phase near Bitcoin’s previous all-time high aligns with the “equilibrium to euphoria boundary,” where the price tends to appreciate quickly followed by the LTH increasing their distribution pressure.Share this articleDon’t have an account?

TechLead has been taking down critical videos,https://protos.com/techlead-has-been-taking-down-critical-videos/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,25-06,"According to TechLead, a.k.a Patrick Shyu, the ‘ex-Google, ex-Meta tech lead’ who started a successful YouTube career after leaving Facebook, he’s been taking down any videos that are critical of his behavior by falsely claiming copyright violations.Shyu, who once launched a cryptocurrency by lying to users about how it was being bootstrapped, has seen his profile diminish since being exposed by fellow YouTube creator Coffeezilla three years ago.But making false promises and running off with a significant profit from a crypto project only to never mention it again hasn’t stopped him from constantly posting on YouTube. Indeed, since his failed crypto launch, he’s released a series of pessimistic videos, with titles ranging from Why Coding is Dead to AGI Achieved It’s Over. He’s also posted at least six videos claiming that he’s either quitting or retiring from both tech and YouTube.He doesn’t appear to have done either.While this is absolutely the first time that TechLead has publicly admitted to abusing the DMCA system, it isn’t the first time he’s tried to have well-known video exposés taken down. He even stated in a now-deleted video that he, “tends to copyright strike down any exposé videos” because he wants to know who is behind them.Years ago, after Coffeezilla covered TechLead’s Million Token scam, TechLead called Coffeezilla racist, attempted to dox him, and sent out copyright takedown claims to other creators covering the topic.Read more: Ben ‘BitBoy’ Armstrong baits media with dramatic YouTube ‘quit’Though TechLead has deleted the video in which he admitted to abusing the DMCA copyright takedown system, that isn’t the only video he’s deleted. According to the social analytics website SocialBlade, TechLead has deleted dozens of videos over the past few days, losing millions and millions of views seemingly overnight. This has taken his channel from a B- rating to a D- rating.Protos asked YouTube how it intends to respond to false DMCA takedown claims and was told that “False claims and misuse of the removal request webform when someone submits a copyright removal request can result in the suspension of an account or other legal consequences.” It’s unclear if YouTube will suspend or take legal action against TechLead.It’s worth pointing out that TechLead’s Million Token is down over 99% from all-time highs reached in July of 2021.Got a tip?

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.Bitcoin bull Metaplanet has established a new subsidiary, Metaplanet Capital Limited, to enhance its Bitcoin management and expand into new regions.According to a June 25 statement, Metaplanet revealed that the subsidiary would be registered in the British Virgin Islands and be a part of its consolidation group companies.The subsidiary will be focused on managing the Tokyo stock exchange-listed firm’s Bitcoin holdings and strengthening its BTC-only strategy. Additionally, the firm would seek to capitalize on international growth opportunities that would aid Metaplanet’s global expansion.It added:“This move allows us to leverage the favorable regulatory environment, optimize our financial strategies, and better position Metaplanet for global market expansion.”The subsidiary’s representative will be Director Simon Gerovich, and its initial capital is $10,000.Over the past months, Metaplanet has acquired 141 Bitcoin worth approximately ¥1.45 billion ($9 million), propelling it into the top 30 corporate BTC holders. Yesterday, it announced plans to issue ¥1 billion ($6.26 million) in ordinary bonds to fund additional purchases of the top digital asset.Metaplanet’s shift to Bitcoin has earned it the moniker of “Asia’s MicroStrategy” within the crypto community. According to the firm, its BTC pivot is driven by recent economic conditions in Japan where the national currency has considerably struggled against the US Dollars. It stated:“Metaplanet’s strategy unequivocally prioritizes a Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only approach for the Company, with the potential use of long-dated yen liabilities and periodic share issuances as strategic financial options to continually accumulate more bitcoin instead of retaining the ever-weaker yen.”Meanwhile, its pro-BTC move has helped its shares rally by more than 500% within the last six months, according to Tradingview data.Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is evaluating a proposal to join the Lido Alliance and establish a dedicated market for the liquid staking protocol’s staked Ethereum (stETH) token.The Lido Alliance aims to promote infrastructure development around stETH, focusing on restaking use cases. This alliance emerged in response to the rising dominance of EigenLayer, an innovative Ethereum restaking protocol that has significantly impacted the industry since its launch last year.The Aave Chan Initiative explained that a dedicated market would enhance the user experience for wstETH holders and maintain the lending protocol as the primary platform for Lido users.Additionally, it would allow the DAO to adopt a more aggressive approach on the main Aave v3 instance, enabling borrowers to pay higher rates for WETH without adversely affecting long-term users.The initiative also noted that a dedicated market would attract new WETH inflows due to Lido and potential Merit incentives. It stated:“[The] benefits for Aave DAO are many. This will solidify our position as venue of choice for wstETH loopers; improve economics of wETH borrow for our users and DAO as we can go with higher rates later; and drive inflows from Lido Alliance incentives and new assets in risk isolated manner. Long term this grows Aave TVL, market share and revenues.”The proposal indicates that the borrowing capacity of WETH on V3 will be set at 90% of the supplied WETH, with updates managed by the risk steward to ensure consistent profitability for both stETH and WETH loops. Further, the High-Efficiency Mode (E-Mode) will be among the most efficient in the industry, with approximately 50 basis points.Meanwhile, support for the move appears strong, with the Aave community approving a preliminary temperature check to launch the market last week. Following the vote, Aave founder Stani Kulechov commented:“[The] first tailored Aave market for Lido is coming online. Aave V3 is flexible enough to cater any kind of risk configuration preferences based on specific needs.”Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

                            CryptoQuant research manager Julio Moreno predicts that there may be a major correction in Bitcoin if the $ 56,000 level is broken.Bitcoin continues to worry investors with its declines. As expectations increase that the decline may deepen further, CryptoQuant research manager Julio Moreno announced his BTC expectations.Applying Metcalfe's law for the Bitcoin price, Moreno said that the final support level for the BTC price is $ 56,000.Pointing out that while $56,000 was the resistance level for BTC in previous months, it was the support level in May, the analyst said that this level is already critical.According to the analyst, if this level is broken in Bitcoin, there may be a major correction.“The final support level of Bitcoin price is $56,000 according to the Metcalfe price valuation bands (red line).This metric marked resistance/highs in the previous cycle, but acted as support in May.“If there is a break below this level, a major correction may occur.”Bitcoin continues to trade at $61,041 at the time of writing.*This is not investment advice.ΔΔCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

Ethereum options traders still bullish despite recent crash: Kaiko,https://cryptobriefing.com/ethereum-market-trends-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,25-06,"Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleEthereum (ETH) options traders maintain a bullish stance despite the recent market turbulence, according to analysts at Kaiko. This analysis is backed by the put-call ratio dynamics, which raised in May and suggested a bearish sentiment as more puts than calls were bought.However, this trend reversed in June as the ratio declined, indicating a shift towards bullish bets. This optimism is further supported by the trading volumes at higher strike prices for December expiries, where a significant number of calls exceed the current price levels.The positive shift in trader sentiment can be linked to recent regulatory developments, Kaiko analysts highlighted. Last week, the SEC concluded its investigation into ConsenSys regarding Ethereum’s status as a security, which has likely contributed to the bullish outlook among traders.Moreover, as reported by Crypto Briefing, the spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) are likely to start trading in the US on July 2nd. This information was later reiterated by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.Therefore, this could potentially trigger a price leap for Ethereum, as experts shared with Crypto Briefing near the ETF approval in May. Although some of the upward movement might be already priced, there’s a significant chance that ETH might sharply increase its price following the start of the ETF trading in the US.Share this articleDon’t have an account?

He was addressing questions about former President Donald Trump’s increasing support for cryptocurrencies and criticism of his agency from figures like Mark Cuban.On the topic of the much-anticipated Ethereum spot ETFs, Gensler also provided an update.“We actually went live last year with an Ethereum futures ETF,” he noted, before addressing filings for cash-based Ethereum exchange-traded products. He said that while the timing for the approval is uncertain, the process is ""going smoothly,"" and depends on asset managers providing full disclosures for their registration statements to go effective. Some market watchers believe the first funds could launch next week.“My role as a securities regulator—as chair of this great 5,000-person agency that oversees $120 trillion capital markets—is to look out for investors, look out for issuers and, where appropriate, to be a cop on the beat,” he said.He reiterated that his primary focus is on maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, regardless of the political climate.“I’m focused every day on that part of my job, which is protecting the investors, looking after issuers’ access to markets,” he added.Despite the growing political discourse surrounding crypto, he maintained that his duty is to regulate and not engage in election-related discussions.This discussion comes at a time when crypto has become a significant issue in national U.S. politics. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has notably increased his support for cryptocurrencies, advocating for Bitcoin mining and accepting political donations in crypto. He has positioned himself against what he calls Pres. Joe Biden's “crusade to crush crypto.”Your gateway into the world of Web3The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.© A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc."

The second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), traded in the bearish wave and continued to erode gains for the past few trading sessions. Since the end of May 2024, the sentiments in the crypto market have looked bearish, and follow-on retracement has been noted. Amidst no negative news and no rate cuts announced by the Federal Reserve, the market leaders (BTC and ETH) failed to gain momentum and continued to reduce the gains.Notably, the Ethereum (ETH) coin depicted lower low swings and has breached its crucial support $3500 mark this week. Meanwhile, the sellers are likely to push the ETH price toward the $3200 mark shortly. Nonetheless, it has respected the trendline support region and still looks neutral.A falling wedge pattern was noted, known for its bullish reversal, and Ethereum has completed the 4th wave; it looks like the retracement is over, and it might see a rebound soon.A break and close above the $3550 might trigger a sharp rebound and will pull ETH price toward the $3800 mark soon.At press time, the Ethereum price traded at $3371 with an intraday surge of 1.36%, reflecting neutrality on the charts. It has a monthly return ratio of -9.20% and 77.20% yearly, reflecting short-term consolidation.Analysts are guiding their bullish view and suggest that the ETH price may reflect a rebound and approach the $3800 mark soon.The Ethereum (ETH) price has done its retracement, retested the 100-day EMA mark, and respected the trendline of the falling wedge pattern. Notably, the chart structure is still positive, and only a single bounce above the $3550 mark would trap the bear cartel.Source: TradingViewIts Momentum Oscillator, RSI curve stays in the negative region and plots a negative crossover. Similarly, the MACD indicator plots the red bars and directs a bearish outlook.Moreover, the price action highlights a retracement, and the coin has regressed to its 38.2% Fib zone. Interestingly, the $3300 mark is the strong support zone.Notably, the trading volume remained flat and soared over 6.57% to $16.03 Billion. The total supply of ETH is 122.37 million and has a fully diluted market cap of $413.93 Billion.A post by @DaanCrypto on the X platform highlighted that the ETH price is still in the consolidation phase and hovering on an upward trajectory.$ETH Still consolidating against the big downtrend line which has been rejecting price for the past ~2 years.I suspect we'll see the ETH/BTC ratio move up quickly once that finally breaks and ETH can hold on to the break out.0.06 main level to break to reverse the HTF trend. pic.twitter.com/9ZC7omJ9OeSource: XThe Active Addresses of Ethereum (ETH) dropped over 32% to 505k and witnessed a decline in investor interest.Source: SantimentLikewise, the transaction count data revealed a notable decline of over 21% and dragged to 845k, implying a reduced transaction activity this week.The Futures OI data revealed the buyers have started accumulating and are looking for a significant pullback to retain the $3500 mark shortly.Source: CoinGlassThe open interest data highlights a surge of over 1.28% to $15.03 Billion in the last 24 hours, revealing the longs addition.The immediate support levels for the ETH token are $3300 and $3200, whereas the key upside hurdle is around $3440, followed by $3650.Amidst the significant profit booking from the top, the ETH price has done the selloff and retested the $3300 mark this week.

"Ripple’s Monica Long: “There’s So Much More Upside Potential for the XRP Ledger Decentralized Exchange""",https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/06/we-think-of-stablecoins-and-xrp-as-complementary-and-additive-says-ripple-preident/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,49 m-,"In a recent interview with The Block’s Director of Special Projects, Frank Chaparro, for episode 38 of The Scoop podcast, Ripple President Monica Long shared her thoughts on the current state and future of Ripple, crypto regulations, and blockchain technology. The conversation covered a wide range of topics, including Ripple’s ongoing legal battles, the expansion of their business, and the broader landscape of crypto regulation and adoption.Long started by highlighting the significant developments since their last public discussion. She noted that Ripple received a favorable court decision in July 2023 regarding their case with the SEC, which clarified that XRP is not considered a security. She said this decision has provided Ripple with the clarity needed to move forward with their business operations in the United States. Despite the regulatory challenges, she claimed, Ripple’s business continues to grow, expanding beyond cross-border payments to include a broader range of blockchain infrastructure services.Long also mentioned that Ripple’s focus has shifted from solely serving cross-border payments to becoming a holistic enterprise blockchain infrastructure provider. They have built essential infrastructure to support connectivity between blockchains and traditional financial rails, enabling them to serve over 80 markets globally. The acquisition of Medico, now Ripple Custody, has enhanced their ability to provide custody services, which is crucial for their payment customers and large banks.Long addressed the ongoing regulatory environment in the U.S., describing the SEC’s approach as a “war on crypto” driven by enforcement rather than clear rules. Despite this, she noted that Ripple has seen more growth in regions where governments have established clear regulations, such as Europe, Singapore, and Brazil. These regions, she said, have provided regulatory clarity, enabling Ripple to expand their operations and serve a growing number of customers.A significant part of the conversation focused on Ripple’s decision to launch a USD stablecoin. Long explained that stablecoins and XRP are complementary, serving different use cases within their ecosystem. While XRP acts as a bridge asset for cross-currency or cross-token settlements, stablecoins are used for transactions where stability and cost-efficiency are crucial, such as USD to EUR flows. Ripple’s stablecoin will initially target their existing payment customers and banks, leveraging their established relationships and infrastructure.Long discussed the increasing interest in tokenizing real-world assets, such as securities and money market funds. Ripple’s custody product apparently supports these tokenization efforts, enabling customers to tokenize a variety of assets securely and efficiently. Long added that the growing interest from large institutions in tokenizing assets signifies a broader acceptance of blockchain technology in traditional finance.Looking ahead, Long expressed excitement about the potential for further innovations and expansions within Ripple. She mentioned the possibility of launching a spot XRP ETF, highlighting the court’s ruling that provided clarity for XRP and Bitcoin as the only two crypto assets in the U.S. with such a status. Long also emphasized the value of the infrastructure Ripple has built over the years, positioning them to serve a wide range of enterprise use cases beyond payments.The views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

"Bitcoin on Cusp of ‘Top Heavy’ Zone As New Phase Begins, According to On-Chain Analyst – Here’s What He Means",https://dailyhodl.com/2024/06/25/bitcoin-on-cusp-of-top-heavy-zone-as-new-phase-begins-according-to-on-chain-analyst-heres-what-he-means/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,25-06,"Bitcoin (BTC) is at risk of witnessing more corrections as it is on the verge of hitting a “top-heavy” zone, says a popular on-chain analyst.The pseudonymous crypto trader known as Checkmate tells his 94,500 followers on the social media platform X that top-heavy zones happen when “too many people buy too many coins at too high of a price.”“A critical question in these scenarios is ‘Ok, they are underwater, but by how much? How bad is it?’ Being underwater by -1% is very different to -20%.On an Unrealised profit basis, Bitcoin short-term holders are at a key decision point. We’d expect a bounce here… but also a phase shift.”Checkmate encourages traders to pay attention to potential trigger points that could suggest a shift in sentiment.“Whilst we’re not ‘Top Heavy’ yet, we’re on the cusp of moving into it. Chop-solidation remains my base case, and markets often have to go down before they go up again.After 18 months of pure up-only price action, a period of several months of consolidating and correcting is not only expected but required. Don’t get shaken out folks, but that often requires managing near-term expectations. Keep things in perspective. Stay Humble and stack sats.”BTC is trading at $60,541 at time of writing and is down nearly 5% in the past 24 hours.Generated Image: MidjourneyCovering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.CategoriesBitcoin • Ethereum • Trading •

                            In his statement, Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel examined the reasons why the Bitcoin price could not recover.Bitcoin faces significant challenges. Currently in its third worst week of the year, BTC is down over 4.5%.Despite this decline, BTC has increased by 38% year-to-date. However, recent market trends in June showed signs of capitulation similar to the decline observed in early May.Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), gave information about the current situation of the cryptocurrency market. Thiel explained several factors contributing to the downward pressure on Bitcoin. According to the CEO, the German government sold approximately 50,000 BTC and Mt. Bitcoin distribution expected from Gox bankruptcy creates supply shocks. Also influencing the market are macroeconomic expectations and the fact that miners are selling a significant portion of their Bitcoin to fund their operations and expansion.Thiel noted that Bitcoin's correlation with risky assets is another factor in its recent performance. The market has seen an outflow of approximately $1.2 billion from ETFs, indicating reduced demand. Some analysts predict that Bitcoin may find support at the $57,000 level, but it remains to be seen whether it can surpass the $68,000 to $69,000 threshold.As CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings, Thiel discussed the impact of Bitcoin's performance on the company's shares. Marathon Digital, a company that mines digital assets, especially Bitcoin, is directly affected by the volatility of cryptocurrencies. Thiel said it is important to maintain a strong balance sheet and diversify business activities to reduce risks associated with Bitcoin's volatility.Looking ahead, Thiel addressed the upcoming 2024 presidential election and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency market. He observed that former President Trump positioned himself as pro-Bitcoin and advocated for more domestic Bitcoin mining. In contrast, the Biden administration has taken a hostile stance towards Bitcoin, but there are signs of a shift given the significant voter base interested in cryptocurrencies. Thiel said bipartisan support is needed in Congress for Bitcoin and crypto legislation.*This is not investment advice.ΔΔCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

UK’s young voters call for ‘crypto’ to be moved up the political agenda,https://coingeek.com/uk-young-voters-call-for-crypto-to-be-moved-up-the-political-agenda/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,25-06,"Home » Press Releases » UK’s young voters call for ‘crypto’ to be moved up the political agenda Press Releases   3 hours ago  Edinburgh & London, Monday 24 June 2024 – According to new data released today ahead of the upcoming general election, more than a third of young adults in the U.K. believe “crypto” is an important electoral issue.Research commissioned by Zumo, the B2B digital assets infrastructure, and conducted by Focaldata reveals 34% of both 18-24 and 25-34 year-olds think the growth of the “crypto” industry should be front of mind for the country’s politicians.A quarter of all adults (and 44% in London, a prominent fintech hub) think it’s now important for economic growth that the U.K. strengthens its position as a digital assets hub, with the figure rising to four in ten 18-24 year-olds (42%) and 25-34 year-olds (41%).This sentiment follows the recent consultation by the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on a Digital Securities Sandbox, which aims to facilitate the use of digital assets in financial markets. In May 2024, the first U.K. “crypto” exchange traded products (ETPs) listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).Zumo and public opinion research company Focaldata’s poll of more than 3,000 U.K. adults also showed 38% of 18-24 year-olds have invested in “cryptocurrencies” themselves, whilst 40% (and 37% of 25-34 year-olds) know friends and family who hold “crypto.” A similar proportion (39%) of 18-24 year-olds (and 37% of 25-34 year-olds) see the nascent sector as a pathway to higher long-term returns on their investments.However, a third (32%) of both 18-24 and 25-34 year-olds say they are now concerned about the sector’s future prospects, given a number of “crypto-friendly” MPs have confirmed they are standing down at the election.Nick Jones, Founder and CEO, Zumo said: “As crypto moves mainstream, it’s clear from our findings that the nation’s young adults are keen for it also to move up the political agenda.”“Given the widespread recent turmoil in the traditional financial system, the UK should be championing alternative financial solutions, not panicking and likening them to gambling – as we’ve seen in recent press coverage. A resilient future financial system should look to incorporate new ideas and structures that provide added value for consumers.”“Moving forward, we’re keen to see the government and the regulators working in step with the industry to implement an appropriate regulatory framework that will help the digital assets sector reach its full potential as a growth driver for the UK economy.”Zumo was the first digital asset platform to integrate tech-based requirements of the FCA’s new financial promotions regime for “crypto asset” firms, which took effect in October 2023. This timely response underscored the company’s commitment to adhering to regulatory guidelines and maintaining consumer protection.MethodologyZumo used Focaldata to conduct a poll among a representative sample of the GB public. Data was collected from a sample of 3,124 U.K. adults between 7 and 11 June 2024. Data was weighted to be representative of the public by age, gender, education, region and ethnicity. For interview requests or other press enquiries, please contact: Amelie Arras, Marketing Director, Zumo ([email protected]) About ZumoZumo believes everyone should have access to sustainable finance, and that blockchain has the power to deliver this globally.

                            Moody's Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi, in his latest interview with Bloomberg Television, expressed his belief that the FED should start reducing interest rates due to the slowing economy.Zandi pointed out that GDP growth, which was 2.5% last year, was 1.5% on an annual basis in the first half of the year. This is below the economy's potential. He also stated that unemployment started to rise and first applications for unemployment benefits started to increase.According to the analyst, inflation is already approaching the FED's target, especially if rents, which are very problematic, are excluded. Zandi believes these factors strongly indicate that the Fed should lower interest rates.Zandi argues that an economic downturn could have been avoided if the Fed had waited another month or two, or even until after the election. However, it questions why we should take this risk or chance. He warned that the economy was very vulnerable to anything that could go wrong, including upcoming elections.Zandi's views contrast with those of Michelle Bowman, who says there is still an upside risk to inflation and now is not the time to cut rates. RenMac's Neil Dutta asked if the Fed had looked at yesterday's data and whether they were in danger of falling behind and making policy mistakes. Zandi agreed, saying, “There's a real chance they'll make a mistake here.”Zandi also explained that the economy softened too quickly and became fragile. He also pointed out that the financial system is under great pressure. The yield curve is still inverted, which is not a good position for many banks and other financial institutions. Credit growth is slowing due to tightening and underwriting after last year's banking crisis. Credit quality is moving in the wrong direction.Zandi concluded by saying that the risks are asymmetric at this point and the FED should start reducing interest rates.*This is not investment advice.ΔΔCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

"Privacy coins, crypto mixers, and money launderers: bitter pills in crypto mass adoption?",https://crypto.news/privacy-coins-crypto-mixers-and-money-launderers-bitter-pills-in-crypto-mass-adoption/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,25-06,"
Share We examine the dual-edged sword of privacy in crypto, looking into how anonymity tools like mixers and privacy coins have impacted mass adoption amidst rising financial crimes.On Jan. 3, 2009, the public got the chance to experience what anonymity in finance actually meant—something we know today as cryptocurrency. The inventors of crypto saw it as a way to save economies from crashing due to the shortcomings of fiat currencies. Fast forward to the present, and financial watchdogs are battling the use of virtual currencies due to the tendency of fraudsters to use them to make away with billions of dollars every year.Certainly, there’s a notion that money launderers like to use crypto to steal people’s funds because it’s supposedly untraceable. Whether it’s through crypto mixers or privacy coins, the sentiment has tarnished the image of crypto, but to what extent? Let’s find out.Before we look at how much crypto mixers and privacy coins have impacted the virtual currency landscape, let’s get one thing straight: cryptocurrency is more pseudonymous than it is anonymous. In lay language, it means that the digital ledgers behind them do not hide the fact that a transaction has been made, they hide who exactly made it. So, in essence, crypto is not entirely untraceable. And that is why some developers within the crypto community decided to create a way to completely anonymize transactions, and two ways to do that were through crypto mixers and privacy coins.Crypto mixers, or tumblers, are platforms that take potentially associated funds and pool them with others to make it difficult to establish the source of certain coins. On the other hand, privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that employ certain sophisticated features of cryptography, like stealth addresses, to enhance the obscurity of their users.Privacy coins and crypto mixers’ purpose is probably the reason why financial fraudsters use them to hide where the money is going. Chainalysis released a report earlier this year, showing there was about $24.2 billion worth of crypto received by illicit addresses in the financial year 2023.Taking a deeper look into this, we can unpack events that support what scammers think when going the crypto way:According to the European Union’s (EU) Innovation Hub for Internal Security, hackers and scammers often launder stolen funds using crypto mixing services like Tornado Cash to obscure traceability and evade detection. Per the EU hub, the services have massively slowed down the efforts of regulators to create grounds for crypto mass adoption.📢 Just published: new report on the use of encrypted communications in criminal investigations.The report, from the EU Innovation Hub, stresses balance between security & privacy.Download here 👇https://t.co/wJUocAi32y pic.twitter.com/dA9dbfVSwxLooking at the case presented against the co-founder of Tornado Cash, maybe the EU is pointing fingers in the right direction. Recently, identified by blockchain analytics entity Arkham Intelligence, Orbit Chain saw an exploiter move about $47.7 million to Tornado Cash. The funds are a portion of $82 million stolen from the network back in January. We can only speculate what the hacker wants to do with the funds shifted to the crypto mixers. Sadly, such incidents have fueled the fate of Tornado Cash co-founder Alexey Pertsev, who was sentenced to sixty-four months for money laundering in May by a Dutch court.Crypto mixers such as Tornado Cash were meant to increase the anonymity factor of using virtual currencies. However, money launderers and scammers found a way to “corrupt” the service, forcing some open source software makers to draw back on creating them or improving their functionalities for fear of prosecution.Tornado Cash:NOBODY EVER OWNED IT OR OPERATED IT.On Ethereum, you can write & deploy an unownable, unstoppable, non-custodial open source app that runs on its own FOREVER.This is new tech. It deserves new laws.Throwing people in prison for writing code is UNJUST.Although the crypto community is rallying behind the Tornado Cash co-founder, with privacy advocate Chris Blec emphasizing the need for new legislation to safeguard user privacy in emerging blockchain technologies, the damage may have already been done.Privacy coins have their merits and liabilities, but overall, they present a development in crypto that enthusiasts want to see move forward. These digital assets, for example, Monero (XMR), echo the very things cryptocurrency users want in their entirety: confidentiality and discretion. Unfortunately for the community, those two entities are exactly the music money launderers, hackers, and scammers want to hear. So, they take advantage of the characteristics and perks of using privacy coins.In Chainalysis’ recent crypto crime report, Monero was said to have been widely used by CSAM (child sexual abuse material) vendors in the financial year 2023. Per the crypto statistics firm, Monero plays a more significant role in enabling CSAM vendors to launder their on-chain earnings rather than solely obscuring the purchases themselves.Chainalysis shared a snapshot of a CSAM-affiliated dark web forum asking for donations in Monero.They believe the vendors are asking for Monero because it leverages instant exchanges. Instant exchangers operate without holding users’ funds and generally do not support crypto-to-fiat conversions. However, unlike decentralized finance protocols, they are centrally managed by a single organization. Furthermore, these exchanges leverage liquidity from multiple exchanges to offer competitive prices and facilitate direct crypto-to-crypto exchanges between users’ wallets, often making on-chain transactions challenging to trace. Combined with lax know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, these platforms can be advantageous for obscuring the origin of cryptocurrency transactions.Back in 2021, the gaming community faced hackers who snatched away their fortunes by installing malware on very popular titles. The malware, dubbed crackanosh, was used by cybercriminals to draw the powers of computers globally and use them in mining cryptocurrency. Since gaming rigs are usually quite powerful by design, their processing powers became a good offer that the hackers couldn’t pass, and they made over $2 million worth of Monero from the illicit activity.Why did they choose to mine Monero? Well, it could be because it’s easier to mine than cryptos like Bitcoin. However, maybe it is because with Monero, they could somewhat easily exchange the digital currencies to fiat and go about their happily ever afters.The tales could make us feel like Monero does more harm than good, and that is absolutely not the case. Privacy coins were developed to improve the functionality and use cases of the crypto industry. But scammers and money launderers have tarnished their reputations and brought greater scrutiny from financial and regulatory watchdogs.Recently, blockchain data analysis company Bitrace CEO Isabel SHI gave her insights on crypto crime at an event held at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Isabel SHI, the CEO of Bitrace, was invited to Hong Kong Polytechnic University to give a presentation titled ""Cryptocurrency in Crime and Money Laundering"". She explored why cryptocurrencies are widely used in criminal activities, introduced new types of crimes brought about by…Isabel started by breaking down the reasons behind the widespread use of cryptocurrencies in criminal activities. She emphasized that the anonymity, decentralization, and ease of cross-border transfers make cryptocurrencies inherently suitable for illegal purposes. The CEO pointed out that on-chain addresses do not necessitate KYC verification, thereby masking transactions from real-world identities. She also noted that the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies ensures that only those with private keys can access their assets. Moreover, Isabel highlighted that the permissionless and borderless nature of cryptocurrencies enables transactions to be conducted globally at any time, making them particularly attractive to criminals.From Bitrace and Isabel’s insight, we can see that fraudulent tendencies arise from loopholes present in blockchain ecosystems. And to stop them, we might need to employ certain parameters that will not only eliminate the problem of attracting money launderers and scammers but also provide grounds for crypto mixers and privacy coins to thrive without a bad name.Here is what crypto mixers and privacy coin developers can do to stop money launderers, hackers, and scammers from using the services for illicit activities and spearhead crypto mass adoption:Though the use of crypto mixers and privacy coins has been an issue in achieving mass adoption for cryptocurrencies, their contribution to improving financial privacy cannot be ignored. While offering a desirable feature to some of their users, the anonymity issues have been associated with regulatory compliance and unlawful activities. Nevertheless, the necessary actions should be taken by developers, who should increase controls and cooperate with the bodies that regulate such areas. However, as the world changes and new technologies emerge, achieving the critical cryptocurrency adoption rate, even with such protective elements, is quite feasible. By recognizing that privacy and regulation can coexist, the outlook for cryptocurrencies can remain positive for both regulators and crypto users.

But Saga’s network is designed to launch dedicated chains, and can be used to support games and apps launched on other blockchain networks.It’s not immediately clear whether the Immutable migration will impact those plans with Saga.

                            SEC Chairman Gary Gensler focused on the cryptocurrency issue and evaluated the situation in a speech he made today.U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler recently spoke at the Bloomberg Investment Summit. He touched on the growing intersection of cryptocurrencies and politics, as if emphasizing his role as a securities regulator.Gensler stated that there is no inconsistency between crypto securities and securities laws, however, they know that these laws are still violated.The conversation took an interesting turn when the topic of upcoming elections came up. Cryptocurrencies have become a hot topic in the political landscape, with reports suggesting that former President Trump will speak at a major Bitcoin conference and pledge to end what Joe Biden calls his war on crypto.Businessman Mark Cuban even suggested that Gensler's stance on crypto could potentially cost Biden the election. But Gensler declined to comment on these political speculations, reiterating his role as a securities regulator.“I'm just really looking at my role as a securities regulator, as the head of this massive 5,000-person institution,” Gensler said. “We're here to keep an eye on investors, keep an eye on issuers and be on the lookout where appropriate.”Despite the political activity around crypto, Gensler remains focused on its regulatory role, protecting investors, ensuring fair access to markets, and maintaining orderly and efficient markets.As the election approaches, Gensler, whose term extends beyond November 5, was asked whether he felt pressure to achieve certain goals before the election. Gensler responded by expressing his gratitude for his role and the privilege of serving the American people:“This is about going after insider trading. It's about making sure accurate disclosures are made. “This is about practice.”Gensler concluded his remarks by emphasizing that his work is not against time, but aims to promote and develop markets on behalf of the American people. Gensler has expressed willingness to serve his full term, which runs through 2026, and has also acknowledged the possibility of leaving earlier as part of democracy.*This is not investment advice.ΔΔCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

                            According to the official statement made by China, executives of a large company were found guilty of stealing altcoins from a victim.Some executives of 360, China's largest security company, were sentenced to three years in prison and their probation periods were extended. The charges included exploiting the Yapi remote code execution vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to a cryptocurrency website and, surprisingly, stealing the 3015.9 Dash (DASH) altcoin.The detailed scheme was revealed between February 9-20, 2023. Criminals identified as Hongmou, Yangmou and Zhangmou managed to infiltrate the target cryptocurrency website by exploiting the Yapi vulnerability. Once inside, they took control of intranet servers through horizontal infiltration and Trojan planting. They then downloaded and analyzed the server's source code to find the victim's cryptocurrency wallet address and private key.With this information, they created a fake instruction to transfer cryptocurrencies from the victim's wallet. The stolen Dash coins were later exchanged for other cryptocurrencies and sold, generating more than 2.5 million yuan of illegal income.DASH is trading around $23 at the time of writing. This means that the total value of the stolen DASH tokens is approximately 70 thousand.*This is not investment advice.ΔΔCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

But the asset has mostly tumbled throughout the month of June. Swooping down from $71,000 amid a flash-crash weeks ago, the asset’s price has plunged as much as 16% since nearing all-time highs.The descent became noticeable as investors digested hawkish tones from the Federal Reserve, Kaiko analyst Dessislava Aubert told Decrypt in a statement. Trimming rate cut projections to one this year after its June policy meeting, the Fed’s move weighed on risk assets, she wrote.But that doesn’t capture the full picture, with crypto-specific factors. Grayscale’s Managing Director of Research Zach Pandl told Decrypt in an interview that Bitcoin’s fundamentals have not changed within the past few days, and the pressure can be explained by three key factors.Outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs, combined with the selling of seized Bitcoin by the German government, and expected selling from Mt. Gox creditors have created an “overhang,” he said.“We don’t exactly know how long this will last, and we don’t know how much selling there will be from Mt. Gox-related assets,” Pandl said. “But because fundamentals haven't really changed, I do think we can anticipate valuations to eventually recover once that has passed.”The dynamic influencing Bitcoin’s price can be compared to “lock boxes,” according to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan. In a post on Twitter (aka X), he explained that various crypto bankruptcies or seizures have historically taken Bitcoin off the market while reducing supply. But that’s shifting.The latest event unlocking swathes of Bitcoin is the repayment of Mt. Gox’s customers, who lost 740,000 Bitcoin when the exchange was hacked in 2014. Though Mt. Gox has moved around $9.6 billion in recovered Bitcoin recently, some analysts think much less will hit the market soon.Galaxy Digital’s Head of Research Alex Thorne estimated that 6,500 Bitcoin could be “dumped on the market” if most investors who get Bitcoin back from Mt. Gox hold their assets. It’s likely, he wrote, considering Mt. Gox’s customers are early adopters who’d have to pay capital gains.Aubert of Kaiko noted that there have been “increased selling pressures from large Bitcoin holders, such as miners,” which doesn’t bode well for the summer. The asset’s volume has been historically low, and those two factors could exacerbate volatility in the market, she wrote.For crypto, there are still price catalysts on the horizon, Pandl of Grayscale said. When spot Ethereum ETFs are eventually approved for trading this summer, he suggested that could create a rising tide for the overall crypto market.“The potential for Ethereum ETF approvals is a big positive catalyst, potentially coming in the next several weeks,” he said. “So, my outlook would remain constructive on the asset class, and I think these are reasonably attractive entry points for investors that have a longer time horizon.”Beyond the crypto market, Wall Street’s AI darling has faced recent headwinds too. After becoming the most valuable company in the world, shares in Nvidia have slipped 7% over the past week, trading hands at around $121.33 as the tech-heavy Nasdaq also retreated slightly.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Your gateway into the world of Web3The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.© A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc."

Despite this slight dip, Lido continues to attract substantial new deposits, underscoring the platform’s appeal to stakers seeking reliable returns.📊 Lido Analytics: June 24 – July 1, 2024TLDR:– TVL up 1.36% to $33.48b.– 95,616 net new ETH staked through Lido.– 7d stETH APR at 2.96%.– wstETH on L2 up 7.19% to 141,586 wstETH.– (w)stETH 7d trading volume at $1.23b.👇Lido’s wrapped stETH (wstETH) on Layer 2 networks rose significantly by 7.19%, totalling 141,586 wstETH. Notable movements within these networks included a substantial increase in Scroll, which surged by 86.26% to 21,181 wstETH. The Base network also grew by 1.55% to 14,895 wstETH. However, minor decreases on Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Linea, and zkSync Era reflected the dynamic nature of staking across different platforms.The amount of (w)stETH in DeFi lending pools saw a slight increase of 0.63%, reaching 2.70 million stETH. Similarly, (w)stETH in liquidity pools rose by 0.62%, totalling 83.5k stETH. On the Cosmos network, wstETH experienced a modest increase of 2.12%, bringing the total to 1,788 wstETH. These figures highlight the growing integration and utilisation of stETH across various DeFi ecosystems and networks.Despite the overall positive metrics, the 7-day trading volume for (w)stETH recorded a 7.25% decrease, totalling $1.23 billion for the week. This drop in trading volume suggests a temporary slowdown in trading activity, though it remains within a healthy range considering the overall market conditions.These updates reflect Lido’s continued growth and resilience in the staking and DeFi space. While some metrics showed minor fluctuations, the overall trend indicates strong performance and increasing adoption of Lido’s staking solutions.

This applies to all types of apps built for the platform, including the Telegram Wallet bot and numerous games.The feature lets users collapse Telegram mini apps into a handy bar at the bottom of the screen, so users can bounce between chats, apps, and games.“The recent Telegram update revolutionizes how people interact with mini apps,” Telegram co-founder and CEO Pavel Durov wrote in his personal channel. “Now people can collapse apps and switch between them.

The service previously claimed some 900 million total users, suggesting that over half of users have tapped and swiped through apps built with the native Telegram framework.Much of that surge appears to be driven by viral crypto games, including Notcoin, which kicked off the tap-to-earn trend on the messaging platform earlier this year—and Hamster Kombat, which claims to have more than 200 million users as it sees rapid growth and adoption ahead of plans to debut a token on The Open Network (TON).With the new feature, Telegram users can more easily bounce between multiple games to tap away at their screens, claim daily login rewards, and more.

Kamala Harris' Odds of Winning Democratic Nomination Surge on Polymarket,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/07/02/kamala-harris-odds-of-winning-democratic-nomination-surge-on-polymarket/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,38 m-,"Vice president Kamala Harris' odds of becoming the Democratic nominee for president this year more than quadrupled on Tuesday, according to traders on Polymarket, the crypto-based prediction market platform that's seen torrid growth in an election year.""Yes"" shares in a contract asking whether she will get the nod traded as high as 31 cents in the afternoon New York time, indicating the market saw a 31% chance it will happen, up from 7% earlier in the day. The shares retraced some gains and recently traded at 23 cents.Each share pays out $1 (in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency pegged to the U.S. dollar) if the prediction comes true, and zero if not.Officially, President Joe Biden is still the presumptive Democratic nominee. But many supporters are calling on him to step aside, and some of them want Harris to step up following her boss's doddering performance at last week's debate with former commander-in-chief and almost-certain Republican standard-bearer Donald J. Trump.""We should do everything we can to bolster her, whether it’s in second place or the top of the ticket,"" Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C, said on television Tuesday.A Newsweek op-ed by former Congressman Tim Ryan, the first presidential candidate to endorse Biden in 2020, was more blunt: ""Kamala Harris Should Be the Democratic Nominee for President in 2024."" An analysis by The Wall Street Journal called Harris ""Biden’s Likeliest Replacement.""The trend was similar Tuesday on PredictIt, a more traditional prediction market platform where bets are settled in dollars rather than crypto. ""Yes"" shares for Harris there more than doubled to 35 cents. PredictIt's volume on the question of who will win the Democratic nomination totals $31 million, dwarfed by Polymarket at $75 million.Under a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Polymarket is barred from doing business in the U.S., whereas PredictIt is allowed to operate in the country under a regulatory exemption.Tuesday was Polymarket's fifth-largest volume day in its four-year history, with $5.7 million in trading, according to Dune Analytics data. June was the first month Polymarket saw more than $100 million in volume.Its largest contract by far, with $211 million in bets, asks who will win the U.S. presidency in November. Trump remains the favorite, with a 66% chance of victory.Meanwhile, KAMA, a meme coin named after the vice president, rallied Tuesday, more than doubling in price over 24 hours to $0.007815.Edited by Aoyon Ashraf.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

But the outcry has given way to a new controversy as some within the Polkadot community say it’s not just a problem of how much is being spent but also on whom, alleging discrimination.Victor Ji, co-founder of Manta Network, criticized Polkadot’s ecosystem as ""highly toxic” Tuesday, urging Asian founders to consider development work on other platforms. In an interview with Decrypt, Ji said projects based in Asia aren’t getting the same treatment as Western ones applying for Polkadot grants, while also being underrepresented on social media.“I’m not trying to raise controversial stuff,” he said. “I don’t think we get comparable support, [...] and we aren’t the only ones. I talked to a lot of founders, particularly ones based in China.”A recent treasury report showed Polkadot, a blockchain network developed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, spent $37 million on marketing initiatives in the first half of this year—nearly half of its total spend of $87 million so far. Containing around $245 million worth of DOT, the report estimated that the treasury also has two years of runway left at its current spending clip.“Marketing expenditures, when done responsibly and in a targeted way, are a source of revenue growth,” Katie Butler, a co-founder of Distractive, a marketing agency committed to the Polkadot ecosystem, told Decrypt in a written statement.“As we mature as an ecosystem, we need more checks and balances to add scrutiny to decision-making and help ensure the community has the information it needs in order to make informed decisions about promotional spend,” she continued.Access grantedCrypto projects associated with Polkadot’s ecosystem can submit applications to receive funding through grants. Ji said that most of the proposals he’s seen from Asian developers are getting rejected, and that the region has been ignored in a way that’s unsustainable.To illustrate his point, Ji wrote on Twitter (aka X) about a discrepancy in Polkadot grants given to Western projects versus those located in Asia. However, not every developer attached to the Polkadot space for that region has had the same experience.In response to Ji, one Twitter user referenced StellaSwap, a popular decentralized exchange built by a Singapore-based firm. In April, a proposal passed granting StellaSwap 1,000,000 DOT (about $6.5 million worth today) from Polkadot’s treasury to grow DeFi activity on the network through pioneering liquidity incentives.Based on his team’s experience, StellaSwap Labs co-founder Aziz Zainuddin doesn’t feel that discrimination toward Asian founders in Polkadot’s ecosystem exists. The pushback his team’s proposal received felt factual and objective, as opposed to being racially motivated. “The scrutiny was very high,” Zainuddin told Decrypt in an interview. “Even though there was a vocal minority, we didn't attribute that to any racial discrimination.”Still, most ecosystems in crypto lean culturally toward North America and Europe, Zainuddin added. Describing Asians as a minority within the crypto community at large, he said it’s understandable that people would perceive barriers, as a result.“I can understand why [Ji] might feel like that, but in our case, we certainly didn't,” he said. “There wasn't even any indication of racial prejudice that we got from the grant process.” Additionally, an Asian research institute focused on Polkadot’s ecosystem received operational funding in May through a grant of 29,700 DOT (about $193,000). Dubbed the Polkadot Ecology Research Institute, the organization of Chinese builders and researchers was founded in 2019.Stating that it has supported over 70 Polkadot-related activities, the organization estimated in its application that the Ecology Research Institute has reached around 40,000 people. So far, the project has submitted eight different grants for funds from the Polkadot treasury.For Ji, a lack of representation on Polkadot’s social media is problematic. Compared to how many Polkadot projects exist in the region, he’s observed “low levels of exposure for Chinese builders” through Polkadot’s official Twitter.The demographic makeup of a Polkadot Academy event in Hong Kong this March also didn’t sit right with Ji either. Even though the event was based in Asia, he said that less than a quarter of the attendees appeared to be from the region.The crypto founder said he felt rebuffed at the event when meeting Wood, who didn’t know that Manta had recently launched. “This definitely means something,” he said, describing Manta as one of Polygon’s biggest projects at the time.Manta Atlantic is known as an execution environment for decentralized applications using zero-proof technology, built using Polkadot’s Substrate framework for so-called parachains. Last September, Manta unveiled Manta Pacific, an Ethereum-based layer-2 scaling network.Marketing malaiseThe marketing spend included in the Polkadot report drew criticism from some community members, who argued the allocations haven’t been a worthy return on investment.However, Yanick Savov, co-founder of NoSpec Consulting and a prominent figure in the Polkadot community, told Decrypt that some of that spent DOT is future-looking.For example, $9 million of that $37 million figure is tied up in a marketing partnership with Inter Miami FC for the next year and a half. Along those lines, he emphasized that certain allocations are not recurring expenses.Addressing concerns about how the marketing spend might impact core development, Savov said the treasury is there for the community and token holders to push forward Polkatod’s OpenGov, a decentralized, open governance platform.Pedro Oliveira, co-founder and CEO of Talent Protocol, highlighted a common challenge in the blockchain space: balancing user acquisition with technological advancement. He warned that high marketing spend can divert resources from core development, potentially slowing innovation.Oliveira suggested several steps for Polkadot to ensure long-term sustainability, including implementing emergency protocols, empowering a small leadership team, reducing marketing costs, focusing on core technology improvements, and exploring new revenue streams. ""Polkadot’s community should evaluate the option of transitioning into an open-source public good, maximizing its technological contributions while reducing operational costs,"" he said.At the same time, some feel a community can have too much control. James Davies, founder and CPO of Crypto Valley Exchange, argued that instead of a purely democratic process, tighter spending controls were needed to ensure Polkadot’s long-term viability. ""Devolving some decision-making to a data-driven core team is crucial,"" he said, adding that transparency and community support are still essential toward Polkadot’s long-term goals.“The treasury is funded by a combination of transaction fees and normal network operations, so increased usage guarantees that there is a continuous inflow of new funds,” Butler of Distractive stated. “For maturity's sake, we also need to continually introduce checks and balances to improve where funds are spent.”Your gateway into the world of Web3The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.© A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc."
PEPE Bullish Signal: Whale Withdraws $14.7 Million Stack From Binance,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/pepe-coin/pepe-bullish-whale-withdraws-14-7-stack-binance/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,42 m-,"On-chain data shows a PEPE whale has withdrawn a large amount of the memecoin from Binance today, a sign that could be bullish for its price.According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive Pepe transaction has been spotted on the blockchain during the last 24 hours.The transfer involved the movement of 1,286,733,285,955 tokens on the network, worth more than $14.7 million when the transaction went through.Given this large scale, it’s likely that a whale entity was responsible for the move. Whales are humongous investors who carry large amounts in their wallets. As they can make huge single-transaction movements like this latest one, they are considered influential beings on the market.Therefore, their moves can be worth keeping an eye on, as they may have implications for the price. Generally, though, it’s hard to say how exactly a move might reflect on the market, but sometimes, the addresses involved can provide some hints.Below are the address details for the latest Pepe whale transaction.As is visible, the sending address for this PEPE transaction was one attached to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Conversely, the receiver wasn’t affiliated with any centralized platform, suggesting that it was likely an investor’s self-custodial wallet.Transfers that move from exchanges to personal addresses are called “exchange outflows.” Generally, investors make outflows from these platforms when they plan to hold in the long term, so these transfers can potentially carry bullish benefits for the cryptocurrency.The whale may have made this latest transfer out of Binance for a similar purpose. It could also be that these coins were just freshly purchased by this large investor, thus making a move even more positive for the memecoin.However, there also exists a bearish scenario where the whale has taken out their PEPE stack to sell through an over-the-counter (OTC) desk instead. As it’s impossible to say with any certainty which of these scenarios this transaction follows, it only remains to be seen what effects this transfer ends up having on the coin’s price, if any.Pepe had recently recovered towards the $0.0000121 level, but the asset has since seen a plunge of almost 5% as its price is now back at around $0.0000115. The chart below shows what the memecoin’s performance has looked like over the last few days.Keshav is currently a senior writer at NewsBTC and has been attached to the website since June 14, 2021. Keshav is currently a senior writer at NewsBTC and has been attached to the website since June 14, 2021. Keshav has been writing for many years, first as a hobbyist and later as a freelancer. He has experience working in a variety of niches, even fiction at one point, but the cryptocurrency industry has been the longest he has been attached to.In terms of official educational qualifications, Keshav holds a bachelor’s degree in Physics from one of the premier institutes of India, the University of Delhi (DU). He started the degree with an aim of eventually making a career in Physics, but the onset of COVID led to a shift in plans. The virus meant that the college classes had to be delivered in the online-mode and with it came free time for him to explore other passions.Initially only seeking to make some beer money, Keshav unexpectedly landed clients offering real projects, after which there was no looking back. Writing was something he had always enjoyed and to be able to do it for a living was like a dream come true.Keshav completed his Physics degree in 2022 and has been focusing on his writing career since, but that doesn’t mean his passion for Physics has ended. He eventually plans to re-enter university to obtain a masters degree in the same field, but perhaps only to satiate his own interest rather than for using it as a means to find employment..Keshav has found blockchain and its concepts fascinating ever since he started going down the rabbit-hole back in 2020. On-chain analysis in particular has been something he likes to research more about, which is why his NewsBTC pieces tend to involve it in some form. Being of the science background, Keshav likes if concepts are clear and consistent, so he generally explains the indicators he talks about in a bit of detail so that the readers can perhaps come out having understood and learnt something new.As for hobbies, Keshav is super into football, anime, and videogames. He enjoys football not only as a watcher, but also as a player. For games, Keshav generally tends towards enjoying singleplayer adventures, with EA FC (formerly FIFA) being the only online game he is active in. Though, perhaps due to being ultra-focused on the game, he is today a semi-pro on the EA FC scene, regularly participating in tournaments and sometimes even taking back prize money.Because of his enthusiasm for anime and games, he also self-learned Japanese along the way to consume some of the untranslated gems out there. The skill didn’t merely remain as just a hobby, either, as he put it to productive use during his exploration for small-time gigs at the start of COVID, fulfilling a couple of Japanese-to-English translation jobs.Keshav is also big into fitness, with agility and acceleration-related workouts making a big part of his program due to the relevance they have in football. On top of that, he also has a more traditional strength based program for the gym, which he does to maintain an overall fitness level of his body.Disclaimer: The information found on NewsBTC is for educational purposes

But with GameStop stock attention once again cooling off, the unofficial GME token is down bad following the latest surge.Solana token GME, which launched back in January, has now lost nearly 79% of its value since blasting off to a new all-time high price of $0.031 on June 7, per data from CoinGecko. It’s now priced at $0.0068, falling another 16% over the past week as the hype around GameStop and bull trader Roaring Kitty loses momentum again.The meme coin surged to that new peak price when Roaring Kitty, aka Keith Gill or DeepFuckingValue, returned to the spotlight in early June with a Reddit disclosure of a sizable holding in GME stock. That was followed by his first YouTube livestream since disappearing from the internet after sparking the 2021 meme stock craze.Gill ultimately boosted his GME stock holdings to some 9 million shares after converting some of his held options last month, but then cooled off on the disclosure posts and curious meme tweets—and there was no second livestream after that initial comeback session.GameStop’s share price has fallen sharply, as well, down by almost half since the early June spike at a current price of $23.98—and all of the latest gains from the past month have evaporated, with the stock down more than 14% over that span.Some traders haven’t taken kindly to the impact of Roaring Kitty’s tweets and posts on the price of GameStop stock. Last week, one trader filed suit against Gill for allegedly committing securities fraud by manipulating the price of the stock. But late Monday, the suit was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs for unknown reasons.Last week, Gill tweeted a cartoonish illustration of a dog—and immediately, the price of pet supplies retailer Chewy and other pet-related stocks briefly surged as traders interpreted his message. That might’ve seemed like a fluke last week, but then on Monday, Gill filed with the SEC to let the regulator know that he purchased 9 million shares of Chewy stock, too.GameStop’s stock price dipped on Monday amid speculation that Gill was giving up on his favorite company. But the losses didn’t stick, with shares up nearly 4% from Monday’s close.Meanwhile, the GME meme coin had a moment in early February, soon after the launch, and then largely faded until early May when Roaring Kitty first reappeared. At that point, the token spiked to what was then a new all-time high price before once more cooling off—and it repeated again in early June when Gill expanded his comeback.Traders still holding on to their GME tokens are no doubt eagerly waiting to see whether Gill’s next moves—or any other GameStop-related happenings—revive demand yet again.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.Your gateway into the world of Web3The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.© A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc."

"Daily Market Review: BTC, ETH, ZK, WLD, TON",https://blockchainreporter.net/daily-market-review-btc-eth-zk-wld-ton/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,02-07,"Today’s market session has seen bears on the front foot, as seen from the drop in the global market cap. The total cap stood at $2.31T as of press time, representing a 0.62% drop over the last 24 hours, while the trading volume stood at $53.4B as of the same period, representing a 0.66% increase over the same period.Bitcoin (BTC) is among the losers in today’s session, as seen from its price movements. Looking at an in-depth analysis, we see that the Alligator’s Jaw (blue line) is currently below the Teeth (red line) and Lips (green line), suggesting a bearish trend as the price is trading below these moving averages. However, the recent convergence of these lines indicates potential consolidation or a slowdown in bearish momentum. On the other hand, the Money Flow Index (MFI) is at 52.10, which is neutral, indicating balanced buying and selling pressures. As of press time, Bitcoin traded at $61,848, representing a 2.8% increase over the last 24 hours.Ethereum (ETH) is among the losers today, as seen from its price movements. An in-depth analysis shows that the Ethereum price is currently around the middle band, suggesting an equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The upper band is $3,504.64, and the lower band is $3,355.27, providing resistance and support levels, respectively. On the other hand, we see that the Volume Oscillator shows a -12.01% change, indicating decreasing trading volume, which often precedes a breakout. As of press time, Ethereum traded at $3409, representing a 1.51% decrease over the last 24 hours.Its price movements show that zkSync (ZK) faces corrections in today’s session. In-depth analysis shows that the zkSync chart features the Supertrend indicator, which shows a sell signal with the Supertrend line above the current zkSync price of 0.1764 USDT. Looking at other indicators, the Woodies Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is at -71.6279, indicating bearish momentum as it is below the -100 threshold. The persistent negative CCI suggests continued downward pressure. As of press time, zkSync traded at $0.1758, representing a 6.9% decrease over the last 24 hours.Worldcoin (WLD) has also failed to post gains today, as seen from its price movements. An in-depth analysis shows that the Worldcoin price is below the Kumo Cloud, and the conversion line (blue) is below the baseline (red), reinforcing the bearish outlook. On the other hand, the ADX (Average Directional Index) is at 48.33, suggesting a strong trend, although directionally bearish. As of press time, Worldcoin traded at $2.25, representing a 0.7% decrease over the last 24 hours.Toncoin (TON) is among the few gainers today, as evidenced by its price movements. In-depth analysis shows the Auto Pitchfork tool, which shows an upward channel. The Toncoin price is currently at the upper boundary of the Pitchfork channel at around 8.041 USDT. On the other hand, the Awesome Oscillator (AO) shows green bars above the zero line, indicating bullish momentum. If Toncoin breaks above the upper boundary of the pitchfork channel, it could signal continued bullish movement. As of press time, Toncoin traded at $8.04, representing a 4.79% increase over the last 24 hours.

"Litecoin (LTC) Sees Positive Cash Inflow, Gains $1.4 Million Amid Market Movement",https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/litecoin-ltc-sees-positive-cash-inflow-gains-1-4-million-amid-market-movement/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,02-07,"Litecoin (LTC) is eyeing a rebound as demand for the digital asset skyrockets. The latest weekly report by CoinShares shows a positive cash inflow in Litecoin institutional products. Despite high anticipation of a bullish 2024, LTC has been among the highest underperformers.Investors have been optimistic about a price breakout based on the successive LTC halving earlier this year. Like Bitcoin (BTC), the digital asset has failed to deliver. Widely viewed as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, the network shares many similarities to Bitcoin.The recent report reveals that Bitcoin’s investment products saw a cash inflow of about $10 million, pushing its AUM to over $67.57 billion. Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) reported modest inflows of $1.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively, signaling some positive momentum building for these assets.The U.S. is leading in investment, with approximately $43 million. Brazil and Australia followed, with inflows of $7.6 million and $3 million, respectively. In the past, Europe has come second, and the emergence of Brazil and Australia signals growing interest in diverse regions.Institutional interest in Solana is based on the recent Solana spot ETF filing. As Crypto News Flash reported, VanEck has become the first financial service provider to file for this ETF with the U.S. SEC. ETF experts speculate that once an Ethereum spot ETF is approved this month, chances of a Solana ETF will skyrocket. Similarly, a Litecoin ETF looks imminent based on its features, which are similar to Bitcoin’s ETF, which was launched at the start of the year.At the time of writing, LTC is exchanging hands for $74.59 after a 6% surge in the last week. These gains are owed to the ETF hype, growing adoption as a payment option, and on-chain metrics support.Bulls are keen to ensure that the digital asset continues to trade above the $70 support position. On the higher side, the altcoin faces resistance at $80 and $90 and, more decisively, $100, which could mark a bullish turning point.Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin, has recently shared the Cryptocurrency’s accomplishments and revealed its future plans. The founder spoke to a leading media outlet at the recent Consensus 2024 conference on the cryptocurrency’s expansion and acceptance over the last six years. From its inception to ranking among the most popular cryptocurrencies, Lee’s observations illuminated the development and future potential of Litecoin.It is important to note that LTC was among the top ten ranked coins by market cap a few years back. However, its subdued performance has seen it get overtaken; at the time of writing, it is ranked 21 with a market cap of $5.5 billion.          No spam, no lies, only insights.

What is decentralized science?,https://cryptobriefing.com/what-is-decentralized-science/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,02-07,"Share this articleDecentralized science (DeSci) is an emerging movement that aims to revolutionize scientific research by leveraging blockchain technology and Web3 principles. At its core, DeSci seeks to address longstanding issues in traditional scientific practices around funding, publishing, and collaboration.The traditional scientific ecosystem faces several key challenges. Limited access to research funding, coupled with lengthy grant application processes favoring established researchers, has discouraged scientists.Peter Higgs, the British physicist who proposed the Higgs boson (sometimes also called the Higgs particle), said in 2013 that he believed no university would employ him today, given the current milieu around academic systems, simply because he would not be considered “productive” enough. Higgs died earlier in April this year, leaving behind a legacy for particle physics.It is this same drive for productivity in the academe that precedes another problem with scientific publications: expensive paywalls. Access to scientific journals is heavily paywalled, relegating research to a closed circuit of privatized knowledge. Although there are projects such as Sci-Hub that support open access rights to information, most major platforms for scientific research are either paywalled or accessible only to those with institutional affiliations.The “publish or perish” adage applies as well to another issue with scientific publication: there is a lack of incentives for researchers to openly share data or reproduce work from other scientists, simply because such work is not rewarded by the current system.Intellectual property disputes among researchers and universities backing their work also hinder innovation. Instead of spending more time actually doing their work, scientific researchers have had to tackle these disputes as well.With the application of blockchain technologies, these conflicts could be resolved and the thrust for productivity among academic institutions, while largely profit-driven, could be satiated with more efficiency gains to boot.DeSci proposes solutions to these issues through decentralized technologies:Democratized funding: Blockchain-based crowdfunding and tokenization of research projects could provide more diverse funding sources. Platforms like VitaDAO allow anyone, not just major institutions, to back early-stage longevity research.Open access publishing: Decentralized platforms aim to make research freely accessible while still incentivizing peer review. ResearchHub, backed by Coinbase’s founder, rewards scientific contributors with cryptocurrency tokens.Improved collaboration: DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) enable global teams to coordinate research efforts. AthenaDAO focuses on historically underfunded women’s health research.IP management: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing research IP could give scientists more control over their work’s commercialization. Molecule Protocol facilitates IP-NFT frameworks for biotech projects.Data sharing: Decentralized storage solutions allow for secure, transparent sharing of research data. GenomesDAO aims to create a user-owned genomics database for advancing medical research.While promising, DeSci faces hurdles to widespread adoption. Traditional academic institutions and publishers may resist changes to established systems, and regulatory challenges around the tokenization of scientific assets also need to be addressed.However, proponents argue that DeSci could lead to more equitable, efficient, and innovative scientific progress. By realigning incentives and lowering barriers to participation, it may accelerate breakthroughs in critical fields like longevity research and climate change solutions.Several pioneering projects are at the forefront of the DeSci movement, each addressing specific challenges in the scientific ecosystem:VitaDAO: Focused on longevity research, VitaDAO has raised over $4 million to fund early-stage projects aimed at extending healthy human lifespans. Backed by Pfizer and former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan, it exemplifies how DAOs can democratize access to emerging therapeutics, challenging the monopoly of traditional biopharma companies.ResearchHub: Founded by Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, ResearchHub aims to become the go-to platform for scientific discussions. It uses a native token, ResearchCoin (RSC), to incentivize contributions like uploading papers, commenting, and peer review. This model seeks to accelerate scientific breakthroughs by rewarding active participation in the research community.Molecule Protocol: This platform bridges biomedical research projects with potential funders using blockchain technology. Molecule introduces the concept of IP-NFTs (Intellectual Property Non-Fungible Tokens), which represent ownership of research intellectual property. This innovation allows for more fluid trading of IP rights and could help projects overcome the “valley of death” in early-stage funding.AthenaDAO: Addressing the critical underfunding of women’s health research, AthenaDAO focuses on conditions like ovarian aging, menopause, and endometriosis. By leveraging a decentralized community, it aims to shift the landscape of women’s health research and improve understanding of female-specific health issues.GenomesDAO: This project is building a user-owned genomics database, allowing individuals to securely store their DNA data and optionally share it with researchers. By giving users control over their genetic information, GenomesDAO aims to accelerate genomic research while maintaining individual privacy and data ownership rights.Bio.xyz: Acting as an accelerator for DeSci projects, Bio.xyz helps launch and fund various biotech-focused DAOs. It provides a launchpad for token auctions, enabling both DAO participants and external investors to support innovative scientific initiatives.These projects demonstrate the diverse applications of blockchain technology in scientific research, from funding mechanisms to data management and collaboration tools. As they continue to gain traction, they could significantly reshape how scientific research is conducted and funded on a global scale.While DeSci presents exciting possibilities, it also faces significant challenges that will shape its future development:Regulatory Hurdles: The tokenization of scientific assets and the use of crypto for funding raise complex regulatory questions. Authorities may scrutinize DeSci projects to ensure compliance with securities laws, potentially slowing adoption. Clear regulatory frameworks specifically addressing DeSci will be crucial for its growth.Resistance from Established Institutions: Traditional academic and publishing institutions may resist the disruption DeSci represents. Entrenched systems of peer review, tenure, and impact factors are deeply ingrained in scientific culture. Overcoming this inertia will require demonstrating clear benefits and gradually shifting academic incentives.Technical Barriers: Many scientists may lack familiarity with blockchain technology and decentralized systems. User-friendly interfaces and educational initiatives will be necessary to lower the barrier to entry for researchers interested in DeSci platforms.Data Privacy and Security: While blockchain can enhance data security, managing sensitive scientific data on decentralized networks poses challenges. Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR while maintaining the benefits of open science will be a delicate balance.Quality Control: As DeSci lowers barriers to publication, maintaining rigorous standards for scientific quality becomes crucial. New mechanisms for peer review and reputation management in decentralized systems will need to adapt and transform but also learn from the tradition.Despite these challenges, the future outlook for DeSci remains promising. As the movement matures, we may see increased collaboration between traditional institutions and DeSci projects, leading to hybrid models that combine the best of both worlds.There could also be some growth in the acceptance of alternative metrics for scientific impact, potentially based on blockchain-verified contributions and real-world applications of research.New scientific fields could also emerge faster, driven by the unique capabilities of decentralized systems, such as large-scale citizen science projects or AI-assisted research coordination.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, decentralized science, if applied at scale, would likely result in a more equitable sphere of participation in scientific research, given how the tools could enable researchers from underrepresented regions to access funding and collaborate globally.The success of DeSci will ultimately depend on its ability to deliver tangible benefits to the scientific community and society at large. If it can demonstrate improved efficiency, fairness, and innovation in research, DeSci could become a transformative force in the scientific landscape, ushering in a new era of open, collaborative, and decentralized scientific discovery.Share this articleDon’t have an account?
