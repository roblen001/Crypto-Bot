Document Reveals Ripple Plans to Sell Only 25B XRP for Operations and Profit,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/06/21/document-reveals-ripple-plans-to-sell-only-25b-xrp-for-operations-and-profit/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"21 June 2024 12:59, UTC-","[ccpw id=""39382""]Date: Written By: Follow Us OnThe XRP Army recently unearthed a document revealing that Ripple intends to liquidate only a quarter of the XRP supply and distribute the balance for further development.The report, authored by three Ripple employees from the markets and business development departments and Roman Leal from Goldman Sachs, reveals that Ripple intends to retain 25% of the total XRP supply.Ripple highlighted that only 100 billion XRP tokens will ever be issued based on the network’s design, and it plans to retain 25% of the total issued assets to fund its operations and generate a profit.This means Ripple schedules to keep a reserve of 25 billion XRP, presently valued at approximately $12.5 billion for company use.Notably, Ripple’s sales of XRP have been in force for years and will continue for the next few years. Amid these sales, the company now holds about 4.87 billion XRP in spendable balance and 39.5 billion in escrow. This puts its XRP reserve at over 44.36 billion tokens.Before the firm secured 55 billion XRP in escrow in 2017, it held 61.68 billion in spendable wallets. With around 44.36 billion XRP left, this implies that Ripple has liquidated over 17 billion XRP over the years.Meanwhile, the document suggests that Ripple plans to distribute the remaining 75% of XRP’s supply to incentivize market makers, gateways, and consumers to use its Ripple protocol. Essentially, 75 billion XRP tokens are up for funding further XRP ecosystem development.By doing so, the company aims to create a demand chain that should increase XRP’s value, given its finite supply. Currently, 55,618,185,850 XRP are in circulation.It is worth noting that this document was published in November 2014, just a few years after the inception of the company. Pro-XRP X user SMQKE called attention to the paper in a recent post.Ripple does not plan on selling all of its XRP. They plan to retain 25% of their XRP to turn a profit and further fund its own operations. The rest is distributed to incentivize the participation of market makers/gateways to UTILIZE THE PROTOCOL ✅“As Demand grows PRICE ⬆️” https://t.co/Rc5dCkvrfA pic.twitter.com/ih0vHDfsWH— SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 20, 2024 This revelation has sparked reactions from community members. Some have dismissed its relevance given that it is a decade old, suggesting the likelihood of Ripple deviating from the proposition in the document.Disclaimer: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

                            According to breaking news, Bloomberg reported that Standard Chartered has launched a spot crypto trading desk for Bitcoin and Ethereum.According to sources familiar with the matter, Standard Chartered is establishing a spot trading desk for Bitcoin and Ethereum.The new crypto desk, which is on the verge of becoming operational, will be integrated into the bank's foreign exchange (FX) trading unit. Sources, who did not want their names to be disclosed while sharing confidential information, announced that the desk will be operated from London.Historically, banks such as Goldman Sachs have been involved in trading assets such as cryptocurrencies. However, strict regulations prevented these banks from dealing directly with the underlying assets. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has suggested that banks should apply a 1,250% risk weight to any unhedged crypto exposure that creates difficulty generating profits.“We are working closely with our regulators to support demand from our institutional customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are aligned with our strategy to support customers across the wider digital asset ecosystem, from access and custody to tokenization and interoperability,” Standard Chartered said in an official statement.*This is not investment advice.ΔΔCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

"Bitcoin falls close to $64,000 as ETFs bleed $140 million",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-etf-outflows-impact/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"21 June 2024 07:27, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin’s price plunged close to $64,000 on Friday, hitting a low of $64,300, according to data from TradingView. The drop followed major withdrawals from US spot Bitcoin ETFs, totaling $139.88 million on Thursday.Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw $53 million in its daily net outflows, while Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) recorded $51 million in outflows, according to SoSoValue’s data.Bitwise Bitcoin ETF experienced $32 million in outflows, while VanEck Bitcoin Trust and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF saw outflows of $4 million and $2 million, respectively.In contrast, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust enjoyed $1.5 million in inflows. There were no flows in ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Franklin Templeton Bitcoin ETF (EZBC), and WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) during the day’s trading session.The latest record marked the fifth consecutive day of losses for US spot Bitcoin ETFs, though this is not the most extended. The longest streak of outflows occurred from April 24 to May 2, resulting in a $1.2 billion reduction.Historically, Bitcoin’s price actions have reflected ETF flows. However, over the past few weeks, numerous factors have taken turns.According to Arkham Intelligence, the recent selling pressure could come from the German government, which has transferred approximately $195 million in Bitcoin to exchanges since June 19. Data shows that the government still holds around $3 billion worth of BTC.UPDATE: German Government Still Selling BTC > $195M So Far.In the past 2 hours, the German Government sent $65M in BTC to 2 likely exchange deposits including Coinbase.The German Government moved $600M BTC yesterday, sending $130M BTC to 4 likely exchange deposits including… pic.twitter.com/in2urlDBE0— Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) June 20, 2024Another factor to consider is hedge funds’ exposure to BTC. According to André Dragosch, Head of Research at ETC Group, hedge funds have reduced their market exposure to a mere 0.37 over the last 20 trading days, a low not seen since October 2020.BOOM: Crypto hedge funds have really thrown in the towel on #Bitcoin lately. They have reduced their $BTC market exposure to only 0.37 over the past 20 trading days. 👀Lowest since October 2020. pic.twitter.com/WZCRK9QlMG— André Dragosch | Bitcoin & Macro ⚡ (@Andre_Dragosch) June 19, 2024Macroeconomic factors, including the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) stance on interest rates, could also affect the market, with cuts unlikely until later this year. The Fed said it needed more data to be confident that inflation is on track to its 2% target.Bitcoin’s bearish momentum could be aggravated by those factors. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $64,500, down almost 8% in a month.Share this articleDon’t have an account? Create oneAlready have an account? Sign InSign In"

With the caption “Unlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn’t clock out at 4 p.m.”, the commercial portrays traditional finance as a senior and tired man, while Ethereum is a more jovial and full of energy version.Unlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4 p.m. pic.twitter.com/0gCJi3wlXp— Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 20, 2024The character representing Ethereum shows surprise when the character portraying the traditional finance market says he’s “gone for the day” after “working non-stop since 9:30 a.m.” He adds that Ethereum would be tired too if it “moved billions around the world.”“Actually, I do. You know, stablecoins, NFTs, loans. People can access me 24/7,” says the character portraying Ethereum, and traditional finance shows surprise at that statement. Additionally, the commercial also jokes about the fact that traditional finance markets don’t work on weekends.As reported by Crypto Briefing, Bitwise has revised its Form S-1 registration statement for its spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), highlighting a potential $100 million investment upon its launch.Moreover, the SEC filing indicates that Pantera Capital Management has shown interest in purchasing up to $100 million of shares in this Ether ETF. However, these indications are not binding commitments, leaving open the possibility of purchasing more, fewer, or no shares at all.Notably, the spot Ether ETFs could start trading in the US within two weeks, as shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on June 14th.Share this articleDon’t have an account?
