However, this correction seems like a large one and was a much-awaited correction. With BTC recovering from $32k to $40k, the altcoins in the market have also been noting a strong recovery on the charts.Polkadot [DOT], VeChain [VET], and Solana [SOL] were among the cryptocurrencies that were holding strong and moving higher.Polkadot [DOT]Source: DOTUSD on TradingViewThe strong dump in the Polkadot market pushed its price from $40 to $18. However, this drop was only momentary and the crypto bounced back above $26. At the time of writing, DOT was trading at $28.26. The token was moving within a restricted range of $26.52 and $29.68, while volatility exited the market.The Bollinger Bands saw the inflated period of volatility converge to indicate the reduced movement of the token. The Signal line dropped under the candlesticks, a development suggesting that the price was moving at a higher level, even within the current range. Meanwhile, the buying pressure was rising as the Relative Strength Index was pushed to 47 from 30. This implied that even though DOT was oversold during the dump, traders saw this as an opportunity to buy the dip.Finally, the Awesome Oscillator suggested that momentum was on the rise and could help the price hold on to its value.VeChain [VET]Source: VETUSD on TradingViewVeChain‚Äôs price broke down after a long time. It had held on to the support at $0.14, however, it dropped to as low as $0.0463. As the market went into recovery mode, VET‚Äôs price bounced back above $0.0906 as it established soft support. The digital asset was trading at $0.1257, at press time, and could test resistance at $0.1334.The volatility remained low, at the time of press, as the Bollinger Bands converged. This recovery pushed the price on an upwards trend and the Signal line moved under the candlesticks suggesting a bullish movement. Rising buying pressure also helped the price move higher.The Relative Strength Index suggested that after dropping well under the oversold zone, VET had returned to above this zone. With buyers showing interest in buying the asset, the RSI value had shot to 51. This was a sign of a stable market, while the money also remained within the market.Solana [SOL]Source: SOLUSD on TradingViewSolana‚Äòs price recently tested the resistance at $42.65, but failed to surpass it. At the time of press, SOL was trading at $42.28 and trying to push past its resistance. The bullishness in the market might help the digital asset to move past this point.The Bollinger Bands suggested that volatility was significant in the SOL market. As the price dropped the second time after testing the resistance, it formed a support level at $39.14. As the price consolidated at this level, the Signal line dropped under the candlesticks and marked an upwards trend for the SOL token. Meanwhile, the buyers have been dominating the market as the Relative Strength Index hit 52, which was a little above the equilibrium level.This bullish momentum clubbed with the MACD‚Äôs bullish signal pointed to SOL‚Äôs move above $42.65.Sign Up For Our  NewsletterWhat do recent market corrections say about ‚ÄòEthereum killers?‚ÄôICP, MATIC, WAVES ‚Äì Which of these alts can lead the recovery phase?Namrata is a full-time journalist at AMBCrypto covering the US and Indian market.

However, before Ethereum ETFs can begin trading, the SEC must also approve S-1 filings.While market analysts thought that approval for S-1 applications for ETH ETFs would come in June and July, the SEC Chairman made a statement that was partially consistent with these predictions.Etheruem continues to trade at $3,518 at the time of writing.*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

                        ",https://coinpedia.org/news/news/dogecoin-finds-major-bullish-catalyst-in-elon-musk-x-payments/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 15:59, UTC-","Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://crypto.news/three-reasons-why-the-crypto-market-fell-on-tuesday/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 20:58, UTC-","
Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause.

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40.

In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks.

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

With the caption ‚ÄúUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn‚Äôt clock out at 4 p.m.‚Äù, the commercial portrays traditional finance as a senior and tired man, while Ethereum is a more jovial and full of energy version.Unlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4 p.m. pic.twitter.com/0gCJi3wlXp‚Äî Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 20, 2024The character representing Ethereum shows surprise when the character portraying the traditional finance market says he‚Äôs ‚Äúgone for the day‚Äù after ‚Äúworking non-stop since 9:30 a.m.‚Äù He adds that Ethereum would be tired too if it ‚Äúmoved billions around the world.‚Äù‚ÄúActually, I do. You know, stablecoins, NFTs, loans. People can access me 24/7,‚Äù says the character portraying Ethereum, and traditional finance shows surprise at that statement. Additionally, the commercial also jokes about the fact that traditional finance markets don‚Äôt work on weekends.As reported by Crypto Briefing, Bitwise has revised its Form S-1 registration statement for its spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), highlighting a potential $100 million investment upon its launch.Moreover, the SEC filing indicates that Pantera Capital Management has shown interest in purchasing up to $100 million of shares in this Ether ETF. However, these indications are not binding commitments, leaving open the possibility of purchasing more, fewer, or no shares at all.Notably, the spot Ether ETFs could start trading in the US within two weeks, as shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on June 14th.Share this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

                        ",https://coinpedia.org/news/news/dogecoin-finds-major-bullish-catalyst-in-elon-musk-x-payments/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 15:59, UTC-","Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                                                        Bitcoin reduced volatility points to market growth and institutional influence
                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                                                        Incoming Bitcoin short squeeze could drive BTC price this high
                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                                                        Incoming Bitcoin short squeeze could drive BTC price this high
                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                                                        Three reasons why the crypto market fell on Tuesday
                        ",https://crypto.news/three-reasons-why-the-crypto-market-fell-on-tuesday/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 20:58, UTC-","
Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40.

In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks.

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

With the caption ‚ÄúUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn‚Äôt clock out at 4 p.m.‚Äù, the commercial portrays traditional finance as a senior and tired man, while Ethereum is a more jovial and full of energy version.Unlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4 p.m. pic.twitter.com/0gCJi3wlXp‚Äî Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 20, 2024The character representing Ethereum shows surprise when the character portraying the traditional finance market says he‚Äôs ‚Äúgone for the day‚Äù after ‚Äúworking non-stop since 9:30 a.m.‚Äù He adds that Ethereum would be tired too if it ‚Äúmoved billions around the world.‚Äù‚ÄúActually, I do. You know, stablecoins, NFTs, loans. People can access me 24/7,‚Äù says the character portraying Ethereum, and traditional finance shows surprise at that statement. Additionally, the commercial also jokes about the fact that traditional finance markets don‚Äôt work on weekends.As reported by Crypto Briefing, Bitwise has revised its Form S-1 registration statement for its spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), highlighting a potential $100 million investment upon its launch.Moreover, the SEC filing indicates that Pantera Capital Management has shown interest in purchasing up to $100 million of shares in this Ether ETF. However, these indications are not binding commitments, leaving open the possibility of purchasing more, fewer, or no shares at all.Notably, the spot Ether ETFs could start trading in the US within two weeks, as shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on June 14th.Share this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

                        ",https://coinpedia.org/news/news/dogecoin-finds-major-bullish-catalyst-in-elon-musk-x-payments/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 15:59, UTC-","Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                                                        Bitcoin reduced volatility points to market growth and institutional influence
                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                                                        Incoming Bitcoin short squeeze could drive BTC price this high
                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                                                        Incoming Bitcoin short squeeze could drive BTC price this high
                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                                                        Three reasons why the crypto market fell on Tuesday
                        ",https://crypto.news/three-reasons-why-the-crypto-market-fell-on-tuesday/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 20:58, UTC-","
Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40.

In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks.

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

With the caption ‚ÄúUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn‚Äôt clock out at 4 p.m.‚Äù, the commercial portrays traditional finance as a senior and tired man, while Ethereum is a more jovial and full of energy version.Unlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4 p.m. pic.twitter.com/0gCJi3wlXp‚Äî Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 20, 2024The character representing Ethereum shows surprise when the character portraying the traditional finance market says he‚Äôs ‚Äúgone for the day‚Äù after ‚Äúworking non-stop since 9:30 a.m.‚Äù He adds that Ethereum would be tired too if it ‚Äúmoved billions around the world.‚Äù‚ÄúActually, I do. You know, stablecoins, NFTs, loans. People can access me 24/7,‚Äù says the character portraying Ethereum, and traditional finance shows surprise at that statement. Additionally, the commercial also jokes about the fact that traditional finance markets don‚Äôt work on weekends.As reported by Crypto Briefing, Bitwise has revised its Form S-1 registration statement for its spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), highlighting a potential $100 million investment upon its launch.Moreover, the SEC filing indicates that Pantera Capital Management has shown interest in purchasing up to $100 million of shares in this Ether ETF. However, these indications are not binding commitments, leaving open the possibility of purchasing more, fewer, or no shares at all.Notably, the spot Ether ETFs could start trading in the US within two weeks, as shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on June 14th.Share this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

                        ",https://coinpedia.org/news/news/dogecoin-finds-major-bullish-catalyst-in-elon-musk-x-payments/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 15:59, UTC-","Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                                                        Bitcoin reduced volatility points to market growth and institutional influence
                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                                                        Incoming Bitcoin short squeeze could drive BTC price this high
                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                                                        Incoming Bitcoin short squeeze could drive BTC price this high
                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                                                        Three reasons why the crypto market fell on Tuesday
                        ",https://crypto.news/three-reasons-why-the-crypto-market-fell-on-tuesday/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 20:58, UTC-","
Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40.

In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks.

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

With the caption ‚ÄúUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn‚Äôt clock out at 4 p.m.‚Äù, the commercial portrays traditional finance as a senior and tired man, while Ethereum is a more jovial and full of energy version.Unlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4 p.m. pic.twitter.com/0gCJi3wlXp‚Äî Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 20, 2024The character representing Ethereum shows surprise when the character portraying the traditional finance market says he‚Äôs ‚Äúgone for the day‚Äù after ‚Äúworking non-stop since 9:30 a.m.‚Äù He adds that Ethereum would be tired too if it ‚Äúmoved billions around the world.‚Äù‚ÄúActually, I do. You know, stablecoins, NFTs, loans. People can access me 24/7,‚Äù says the character portraying Ethereum, and traditional finance shows surprise at that statement. Additionally, the commercial also jokes about the fact that traditional finance markets don‚Äôt work on weekends.As reported by Crypto Briefing, Bitwise has revised its Form S-1 registration statement for its spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), highlighting a potential $100 million investment upon its launch.Moreover, the SEC filing indicates that Pantera Capital Management has shown interest in purchasing up to $100 million of shares in this Ether ETF. However, these indications are not binding commitments, leaving open the possibility of purchasing more, fewer, or no shares at all.Notably, the spot Ether ETFs could start trading in the US within two weeks, as shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on June 14th.Share this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

                        ",https://coinpedia.org/news/news/dogecoin-finds-major-bullish-catalyst-in-elon-musk-x-payments/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 15:59, UTC-","Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                                                        Bitcoin reduced volatility points to market growth and institutional influence
                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                                                        Incoming Bitcoin short squeeze could drive BTC price this high
                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                                                        Incoming Bitcoin short squeeze could drive BTC price this high
                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                                                        Three reasons why the crypto market fell on Tuesday
                        ",https://crypto.news/three-reasons-why-the-crypto-market-fell-on-tuesday/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 20:58, UTC-","
Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40.

In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks.

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

With the caption ‚ÄúUnlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn‚Äôt clock out at 4 p.m.‚Äù, the commercial portrays traditional finance as a senior and tired man, while Ethereum is a more jovial and full of energy version.Unlike Big Finance, Ethereum doesn't clock out at 4 p.m. pic.twitter.com/0gCJi3wlXp‚Äî Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) June 20, 2024The character representing Ethereum shows surprise when the character portraying the traditional finance market says he‚Äôs ‚Äúgone for the day‚Äù after ‚Äúworking non-stop since 9:30 a.m.‚Äù He adds that Ethereum would be tired too if it ‚Äúmoved billions around the world.‚Äù‚ÄúActually, I do. You know, stablecoins, NFTs, loans. People can access me 24/7,‚Äù says the character portraying Ethereum, and traditional finance shows surprise at that statement. Additionally, the commercial also jokes about the fact that traditional finance markets don‚Äôt work on weekends.As reported by Crypto Briefing, Bitwise has revised its Form S-1 registration statement for its spot Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund (ETF), highlighting a potential $100 million investment upon its launch.Moreover, the SEC filing indicates that Pantera Capital Management has shown interest in purchasing up to $100 million of shares in this Ether ETF. However, these indications are not binding commitments, leaving open the possibility of purchasing more, fewer, or no shares at all.Notably, the spot Ether ETFs could start trading in the US within two weeks, as shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on June 14th.Share this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

                        ",https://coinpedia.org/news/news/dogecoin-finds-major-bullish-catalyst-in-elon-musk-x-payments/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 15:59, UTC-","Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                                                        Bitcoin reduced volatility points to market growth and institutional influence
                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                                                        Incoming Bitcoin short squeeze could drive BTC price this high
                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                                                        Incoming Bitcoin short squeeze could drive BTC price this high
                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer. Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00. Toncoin‚Äôs price rose as Bitcoin continued to hover just above $67,000, while Ethereum price ranged near $3,500, making the altcoin‚Äôs surge an impressive one compared to the top two by market cap.Toncoin price rose more than 7% on Friday to reach an all-time high of $8.13.The price gains means a comparison of the average price at which all the 21.49k TON addresses acquired tokens and the current price had all of them ‚ÄúIn the Money.‚ÄùThis is a big jump from a year ago when more than 90% of Toncoin (TON) addresses were out of the money or in loss as TON price hovered around $1.40. The jump in the profitability metric comes as Toncoin witnessed tremendous growth in the past year.Per data from IntoTheBlock, addresses with balances grew from around 5,800 in mid-June 2023 to over 20,870 on June 10.Meanwhile, addresses with less than 10 TON tokens more than doubled in the past three months, increasing from around 4,900 in March to over 10,000 by June 10. In terms of ownership, retail holders currently account for about 39.9% of supply, while whales hold 30.5% and investors 29.5%.A jump in address count has come as The Open Network (TON) blockchain and the native token Toncoin benefitted from a confluence of positive network catalysts.Apart from Telegram‚Äôs support for TON in its ad share program for channel owners, campaigns such as the Open League and the recent parabolic gains for Notcoin (NOT) have all aided the cryptocurrency‚Äôs upward momentum

Share Toncoin (TON)‚Äôs In/Out of the Money data shows all the addresses currently holding the Telegram-related token are in profit.According to data from IntoTheBlock, 100% of addresses with a TON balance are profitable as price hovers near $8.00.

The leading crypto was down 7.5% over the past seven days.Smaller cryptocurrencies saw even steeper declines, with the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index shedding almost 12% week-over-week. Ether (ETH) dropped to $3,400, losing over 10% during this period, while native tokens of rival layer-1 networks Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) and Near (NEAR) sported 15%-20% declines, CoinGecko data shows.The swift tumble liquidated nearly $180 million of leveraged derivatives trading positions across all crypto assets over the past 24 hours, most of them longs betting on higher prices, CoinGlass data shows. This week's shake-out saw a total of over $870 million in liquidations, flushing excess leverage from markets.Analysts and many market participants just a few days ago anticipated an imminent breakout for bitcoin to new record highs, supported by a slower pace of inflation and softer economic data, but attempts for rallies were quickly sold off, leaving BTC stuck in its sideways range.Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Not Keeping Pace With NasdaqThe Federal Reserve this Wednesday projected only one rate cut for this year, less than the central bank's previous forecast, dashing investor hope for looser monetary policy coming this summer.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                                                        Three reasons why the crypto market fell on Tuesday
                        ",https://crypto.news/three-reasons-why-the-crypto-market-fell-on-tuesday/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 20:58, UTC-","
Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

Share Bitcoin (BTC) has witnessed a strong bearish momentum after three days of consolidation, leading to its price fall below the $66,000 mark.Bitcoin is down by 0.9% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $65,600 at the time of writing. The asset‚Äôs market cap also dropped below the $1.3 trillion mark for the second time this month. Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, however, increased by 125%, reaching $36.3 billion.According to data provided by Santiment, the BTC exchange inflow surged by 137% over the past day ‚Äî rising from 19,172 BTC to 45,356 BTC.¬†Data from the market intelligence platform shows that the amount of Bitcoin leaving exchanges has also significantly increased. Per Santiment, the BTC exchange outflow surged by 119% in the past 24 hours ‚Äî rising from 19,871 BTC to 43,493 BTC.Per Santiment, the Bitcoin supply on exchanges also increased from 937,240 BTC to 939,230 BTC over the past day. This shows an exchange net inflow of 1,863 BTC over the past day. The heightened inflows come as the broader cryptocurrency market weathers bearish momentum.Moreover, the global crypto market capitalization declined by 2.6% in the past 24 hours and is currently hovering at $2.485 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. Per data provided by the price aggregator, 96% of the leading 300 cryptocurrencies, including meme coins, are wandering in the red zone.According to Santiment data, the BTC relative strength index (RSI) is sitting at 46 at the reporting time. The indicator shows that the leading cryptocurrency is slightly undervalued.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

However, this correction seems like a large one and was a much-awaited correction. With BTC recovering from $32k to $40k, the altcoins in the market have also been noting a strong recovery on the charts.Polkadot [DOT], VeChain [VET], and Solana [SOL] were among the cryptocurrencies that were holding strong and moving higher.Polkadot [DOT]Source: DOTUSD on TradingViewThe strong dump in the Polkadot market pushed its price from $40 to $18. However, this drop was only momentary and the crypto bounced back above $26. At the time of writing, DOT was trading at $28.26. The token was moving within a restricted range of $26.52 and $29.68, while volatility exited the market.The Bollinger Bands saw the inflated period of volatility converge to indicate the reduced movement of the token. The Signal line dropped under the candlesticks, a development suggesting that the price was moving at a higher level, even within the current range. Meanwhile, the buying pressure was rising as the Relative Strength Index was pushed to 47 from 30. This implied that even though DOT was oversold during the dump, traders saw this as an opportunity to buy the dip.Finally, the Awesome Oscillator suggested that momentum was on the rise and could help the price hold on to its value.VeChain [VET]Source: VETUSD on TradingViewVeChain‚Äôs price broke down after a long time. It had held on to the support at $0.14, however, it dropped to as low as $0.0463. As the market went into recovery mode, VET‚Äôs price bounced back above $0.0906 as it established soft support. The digital asset was trading at $0.1257, at press time, and could test resistance at $0.1334.The volatility remained low, at the time of press, as the Bollinger Bands converged. This recovery pushed the price on an upwards trend and the Signal line moved under the candlesticks suggesting a bullish movement. Rising buying pressure also helped the price move higher.The Relative Strength Index suggested that after dropping well under the oversold zone, VET had returned to above this zone. With buyers showing interest in buying the asset, the RSI value had shot to 51. This was a sign of a stable market, while the money also remained within the market.Solana [SOL]Source: SOLUSD on TradingViewSolana‚Äòs price recently tested the resistance at $42.65, but failed to surpass it. At the time of press, SOL was trading at $42.28 and trying to push past its resistance. The bullishness in the market might help the digital asset to move past this point.The Bollinger Bands suggested that volatility was significant in the SOL market. As the price dropped the second time after testing the resistance, it formed a support level at $39.14. As the price consolidated at this level, the Signal line dropped under the candlesticks and marked an upwards trend for the SOL token. Meanwhile, the buyers have been dominating the market as the Relative Strength Index hit 52, which was a little above the equilibrium level.This bullish momentum clubbed with the MACD‚Äôs bullish signal pointed to SOL‚Äôs move above $42.65.Sign Up For Our  NewsletterWhat do recent market corrections say about ‚ÄòEthereum killers?‚ÄôICP, MATIC, WAVES ‚Äì Which of these alts can lead the recovery phase?Namrata is a full-time journalist at AMBCrypto covering the US and Indian market.

Political uncertainty in Europe with a snap election being called in France also pushed the U.S. dollar index (DXY) higher against other major currencies to its strongest level in more than a month, putting pressure on bitcoin.Bitcoin also struggled with increased selling from miners and profit-taking from long-time holders near the $70,000 area, 10X Research noted, weighing on the broader crypto market.Edited by Stephen Alpher.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

                            Ethereum Spot ETF S-1 is expected to be approved by July 2, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas.Balchunas made the following announcement in his statement:‚ÄúWe're moving our deadline for the launch of the Spot Ether ETF to July 2nd, we heard SEC staff sent out comments to issuers today on S-1s and it's pretty basic stuff, nothing major, they want it back in a week. Good chance to announce they go into effect next week and get this done during the holiday week. Anything is possible, but this is our best guess right now.Our previous cap was July 4th so this isn't a huge change but 1) we were starting to feel like it was going to last longer so that's a bit of good news and b) we're basically half way there in our prediction of what's going to happen and July 2nd is right now that date.‚Äù*This is not investment advice.ŒîŒîI believe it‚Äôs a fake newsCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

                        ",https://finbold.com/incoming-bitcoin-short-squeeze-could-drive-btc-price-this-high/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"16 June 2024 14:44, UTC-","Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) dominated the cryptocurrency market this week as volatility took over and most cryptocurrencies crashed. Bitcoin (BTC) has also suffered from this bearish sentiment, creating a scenario favoring an imminent short squeeze for the asset.In particular, the derivatives market open interest (OI) in Bitcoin remains at all-time high levels, as previously reported. On June 15, Finbold retrieved updated data from CoinGlass showing a $34.5 billion OI with BTC at $66,224.The high speculative demand for opened long and short positions has crafted notable imbalances, which could favor short squeezes. This is because short-sellers leveraged trades created upward liquidity pools, especially at the $72,000 level, a key price resistance.Looking closely, there are over $2 billion worth of Bitcoin short liquidations, with smaller‚Äîbut still relevant‚Äîpools going as high as $73,000. Therefore, the $72,000 to $73,000 zone becomes a likely target in the case of a short squeeze.Notably, the professional trader and analyst who goes by Credible Crypto has spotted other indicators suggesting a short squeeze. In a recent post on X, the analyst pointed to a bullish divergence with the cumulative volume delta (CVD).In a comment, Credible Crypto explained that a down-trending CVD means there are more market sell orders than buys. Thus, the BTC price was expected to go down following the increased selling pressure, which is not happening. The trader believes this is a bullish indicator that buy orders are being consumed and a supply shock is imminent.‚ÄúCVD is not the same as volume- CVD measures the net difference between market buy and sell orders- so when it‚Äôs trending down it means there are more market sells than market buys. Typically this would cause price to drop, but when price isn‚Äôt dropping despite there being a lot of market selling‚Ä¶what does that tell us?‚ÄùNevertheless, technical analyses and awaiting liquidations are not conclusive evidence that a short squeeze will happen. The market‚Äôs state changes every second as cryptocurrency traders reevaluate their positions and change their exposures, market orders, and open interest‚Äîchanging the likelihood of high-volatility events and shifting trends.Disclaimer: The content on this site should not be considered investment advice.

                        ",https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-market-maturity-analysis/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"18 June 2024 12:55, UTC-","Join the hunt for $12,000,000+ in NEXO Tokens!Share this articleBitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) recent price movements reflect a newfound stability in the crypto market, with a notable decrease in volatility, highlighted by a report by on-chain analysis firm Kaiko. Last week, amid US macroeconomic updates, Bitcoin experienced a brief surge from $66,000 to nearly $70,000 before settling back above $66,600, as per the Kaiko BTC Benchmark Reference Rate.Despite the week‚Äôs 4% dip and predominant selling on exchanges, Bitcoin‚Äôs 60-day historical volatility has consistently stayed below 50% since early 2023. This marks a significant change from the behavior seen in 2022, where volatility often exceeded 100%. In contrast, 2024 saw Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility at an all-time low of 40%, even as it hit record highs, a stark difference from the over 106% volatility in 2021.The subdued volatility suggests a maturing market, with the US market close now seeing a higher volume of BTC trades. This shift in market structure, along with the recent performance of spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US, may be influencing the current price stability. Additionally, BlackRock‚Äôs rise to become the manager for the world‚Äôs largest spot Bitcoin ETF, surpassing Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, underscores the evolving landscape of Bitcoin investment.Despite the overall great performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, a streak of 20 consecutive days of inflows was broken last week. Notably, a new streak of three consecutive trading days of outflows is currently being formed, with over $550 million last week and $146 million in outflows on the first day of the current trading week.According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, this could be tied to two key reasons. The first one is that investors lack conviction and are selling below their cost basis.‚ÄúThis is a pattern among ETF investors, where they seem to magnify market moves, as we saw a similar dynamic when there were net inflows in late April of over $1 billion when BTC range highs were above $70,000, followed by significant outflows when range lows approached $60,000,‚Äù Kooner added.The second reason pointed out is the unwinding of the basis arbitrage trade, as significant outflows were registered concurrently to the CME futures open interest for BTC declining by $1.2 billion in the past 10 days.‚ÄúThis could mean that as funding rates have gone negative amidst this price decline, ETF inflows that were part of the basis trade have unwound.‚ÄùShare this articleDon‚Äôt have an account?

She shares the latest and trending news on Cryptocurrency and Blockchain.Elon Musk wants to turn X (formerly Twitter) into an ""everything app"" with features like payments, dating, and news. X is struggling financially since Musk's takeover, with revenue and user engagement dropping. The value of DOGE is currently low and trending downwards, but there might be a short-term price increase in the near future.Imagine a world where you can ditch multiple apps and get everything done on one platform ‚Äì from sending money to your friend to catching up on the latest news or maybe even finding a date. That‚Äôs the future Elon Musk envisions for X, formerly known as Twitter. But hold on, there‚Äôs a wild twist: Musk wants to integrate Dogecoin, the meme coin that started as a joke, into X‚Äôs payment system.Intrigued? Dive deeper to find out how X is shaping up to be the ultimate ‚Äúeverything app‚Äù and why Dogecoin might play a surprising role.According to Bloomberg, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, has confirmed that the development of X Payments LLC is well underway. While specific details are still under wraps, documents submitted to state regulators hint at features similar to Venmo.Musk has consistently emphasized the need for X to diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising, which has historically made up over 90% of its profits. His goal is for X to become the largest financial institution globally, leveraging payment services to boost user engagement and participation on the app.Financial Struggles Financial documents submitted to regulators reveal the company‚Äôs struggles since Musk‚Äôs acquisition in late 2022. Revenue for the first half of 2023 fell to $1.48 billion, a drop of nearly 40% from the same period in 2022.Additionally, the company reported a $456 million loss in the first quarter of 2023. Despite these challenges, Musk‚Äôs vision remains undeterred, with him holding nearly 75% of X Holdings Corp., the parent company of X.At press time, Dogecoin was worth $0.121, having decreased by 10% over the past day. Its 50-period and 200-period moving averages are trending downwards, indicating a strong bearish trend. The price consistently stays below these averages, which act as dynamic resistance levels and reinforce the bears‚Äô control.However, recent movements show the MACD line crossing above the signal line, suggesting a potential bullish reversal or short-term pullback. Nonetheless, DOGE‚Äôs short-term outlook remains bearish.Despite financial hurdles, Musk‚Äôs determination to transform X into a super app remains strong. By integrating Dogecoin and expanding into diverse functionalities, X aims to redefine how users interact with digital platforms. As the development of X Payments progresses, the world watches with bated breath to see how Musk‚Äôs vision unfolds.Also Read : SEC Suspends its Investigation into Ethereum 2.0: Will This Be the Catalyst to Propell ETH Price to $4000?Curious if X‚Äôs gamble will pay off?

Share An analyst cited by CryptoQuant theorized that a bottom was in play with the recent market-wide slump.The total cryptocurrency market declined by more than 7% over the past week and more than 3% in a month. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) dropped below the $65,000 mark while altcoins suffered massive corrections.¬†Altcoins, typically more volatile than Bitcoin, have fared worse than the top virtual currency and lost over 4% of of market value in the last 30 days. BTC has shed around 3% in the same timeframe, but the token seems locked in a sideways pattern.¬†A CryptoQuant report noted that miner capitulation was a major reason for the dip in the total market cap to $2.4 trillion. Following the Bitcoin halving, block rewards were slashed by 50%, and miner revenues fell 55% in tandem.¬†The change in market dynamics has forced miners to finance business expenses by offloading more Bitcoin, contributing to additional selling pressure on the token‚Äôs price and bolstering its ranging price movement.¬†Stablecoins offer a pathway into digital assets by on-ramping and off-ramping liquidity for the decentralized ecosystem. Tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC) are pegged to the U.S. dollar, providing a non-volatile currency for trading.¬†Frequent stablecoin issuance usually indicates an influx of capital and liquidity into the cryptocurrency market. However, analysts noted low stablecoin issuance levels. In other words, new capital flowing into digital assets has somewhat stalled with prices.¬†Spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms like BlackRock and Fidelity broke Wall Street records by reaching multiple billions in assets within weeks. Recently, however, the funds have seen outflows, adding more pressure to Bitcoin prices and the broader digital asset market.¬†More than $600 million exited digital asset investment products last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve policy meeting.Although the market has lulled, analysts opined that a reversal is not out of bounds in the short term. ‚ÄúHistorical trends suggest that periods of sustained low miner revenues combined with a high hash rate can indicate a potential market bottom,‚Äù said a report.¬†

Consumers' Research launched a campaign against USDT stablecoin issuer Tether on Tuesday, accusing the company of being a threat to consumers and raising questions about it being the next FTX.USDT issuer Tether has been the subject of a series of accusations from Consumers' Research over ties to the fallen FTX and its relation to criminal activities.Also read:¬†Tether moves against Venezuelan government's plans to leverage USDT for oil transactionsIn a recent display, the issuer was featured on Times Square with the tag ""Tether to corruption,"" following a press release from Consumer Research confirming it was behind the ad.Consumers' Research‚Äôs CEO, Wild Hild, cited several reports claiming that the company had some unlawful affiliations with Sam Bankman-fried FTX before its demise.Other reports from blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs stated that Tether was the most used stablecoin for criminal activity, linked to $19.3 billion of illegal transactions in 2023. ""Approximately 1.63% of Tether (USDT) volume was linked by TRM to illicit activity, compared to 0.05% of USDC,"" the report stated.Read more:¬†Global Ethereum ETFs experience surge in net inflows as Hashdex files for combined spot ETH and Bitcoin ETFMeanwhile, Consumers' Research launched several other campaigns claiming to expose the largest stablecoin issuer for its affiliations with these bad actors.""We are shining a light on Tether for their suspicious business practices, including a decade-long refusal to perform an audit and the routine use of the product by terrorists and traffickers of drugs and humans,"" said executive director Will Hild.If found guilty, Tether's USDT could experience a depeg from the US dollar due to the FUD such an event would cause. Stablecoins often lose their peg when faced with controversies.Also read:¬†DOGE sees high liquidations as meme coin sector bleeds heavilyA popular example is the LUNA/UST algorithmic stablecoin depeg, which sent the crypto market into a sustained bearish season.Circle's USDC also suffered a depeg in March 2023 due to its exposure to the failing Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Several crypto community members expressed concerns after discovering Circle had significant USDC reserves worth $3.3 billion locked up at SVB.Despite the accusations, Tether has introduced a new stablecoin Alloy (aUSDT), backed by gold, as the company plans to expand its operations.

Sources, who did not want their names to be disclosed while sharing confidential information, announced that the desk will be operated from London.Historically, banks such as Goldman Sachs have been involved in trading assets such as cryptocurrencies.
