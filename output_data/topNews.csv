Document Reveals Ripple Plans to Sell Only 25B XRP for Operations and Profit,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/06/21/document-reveals-ripple-plans-to-sell-only-25b-xrp-for-operations-and-profit/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"21 June 2024 12:59, UTC-","[ccpw id=""39382""]Date: Written By: Follow Us OnThe XRP Army recently unearthed a document revealing that Ripple intends to liquidate only a quarter of the XRP supply and distribute the balance for further development.The report, authored by three Ripple employees from the markets and business development departments and Roman Leal from Goldman Sachs, reveals that Ripple intends to retain 25% of the total XRP supply.Ripple highlighted that only 100 billion XRP tokens will ever be issued based on the network’s design, and it plans to retain 25% of the total issued assets to fund its operations and generate a profit.This means Ripple schedules to keep a reserve of 25 billion XRP, presently valued at approximately $12.5 billion for company use.Notably, Ripple’s sales of XRP have been in force for years and will continue for the next few years. Amid these sales, the company now holds about 4.87 billion XRP in spendable balance and 39.5 billion in escrow. This puts its XRP reserve at over 44.36 billion tokens.Before the firm secured 55 billion XRP in escrow in 2017, it held 61.68 billion in spendable wallets. With around 44.36 billion XRP left, this implies that Ripple has liquidated over 17 billion XRP over the years.Meanwhile, the document suggests that Ripple plans to distribute the remaining 75% of XRP’s supply to incentivize market makers, gateways, and consumers to use its Ripple protocol. Essentially, 75 billion XRP tokens are up for funding further XRP ecosystem development.By doing so, the company aims to create a demand chain that should increase XRP’s value, given its finite supply. Currently, 55,618,185,850 XRP are in circulation.It is worth noting that this document was published in November 2014, just a few years after the inception of the company. Pro-XRP X user SMQKE called attention to the paper in a recent post.Ripple does not plan on selling all of its XRP. They plan to retain 25% of their XRP to turn a profit and further fund its own operations. The rest is distributed to incentivize the participation of market makers/gateways to UTILIZE THE PROTOCOL ✅“As Demand grows PRICE ⬆️” https://t.co/Rc5dCkvrfA pic.twitter.com/ih0vHDfsWH— SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 20, 2024 This revelation has sparked reactions from community members. Some have dismissed its relevance given that it is a decade old, suggesting the likelihood of Ripple deviating from the proposition in the document.Disclaimer: This content is informational and should not be considered financial advice.

                            According to breaking news, Bloomberg reported that Standard Chartered has launched a spot crypto trading desk for Bitcoin and Ethereum.According to sources familiar with the matter, Standard Chartered is establishing a spot trading desk for Bitcoin and Ethereum.The new crypto desk, which is on the verge of becoming operational, will be integrated into the bank's foreign exchange (FX) trading unit. Sources, who did not want their names to be disclosed while sharing confidential information, announced that the desk will be operated from London.Historically, banks such as Goldman Sachs have been involved in trading assets such as cryptocurrencies. However, strict regulations prevented these banks from dealing directly with the underlying assets. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has suggested that banks should apply a 1,250% risk weight to any unhedged crypto exposure that creates difficulty generating profits.“We are working closely with our regulators to support demand from our institutional customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum, and are aligned with our strategy to support customers across the wider digital asset ecosystem, from access and custody to tokenization and interoperability,” Standard Chartered said in an official statement.*This is not investment advice.ΔΔCheck your inbox or spam to confirm your subscription.

The drop followed major withdrawals from US spot Bitcoin ETFs, totaling $139.88 million on Thursday.Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) saw $53 million in its daily net outflows, while Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) recorded $51 million in outflows, according to SoSoValue’s data.Bitwise Bitcoin ETF experienced $32 million in outflows, while VanEck Bitcoin Trust and Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF saw outflows of $4 million and $2 million, respectively.In contrast, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust enjoyed $1.5 million in inflows. There were no flows in ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), Franklin Templeton Bitcoin ETF (EZBC), and WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin (BTCW) during the day’s trading session.The latest record marked the fifth consecutive day of losses for US spot Bitcoin ETFs, though this is not the most extended. The longest streak of outflows occurred from April 24 to May 2, resulting in a $1.2 billion reduction.Historically, Bitcoin’s price actions have reflected ETF flows. However, over the past few weeks, numerous factors have taken turns.According to Arkham Intelligence, the recent selling pressure could come from the German government, which has transferred approximately $195 million in Bitcoin to exchanges since June 19. Data shows that the government still holds around $3 billion worth of BTC.UPDATE: German Government Still Selling BTC > $195M So Far.In the past 2 hours, the German Government sent $65M in BTC to 2 likely exchange deposits including Coinbase.The German Government moved $600M BTC yesterday, sending $130M BTC to 4 likely exchange deposits including… pic.twitter.com/in2urlDBE0— Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) June 20, 2024Another factor to consider is hedge funds’ exposure to BTC.

The Fed said it needed more data to be confident that inflation is on track to its 2% target.Bitcoin’s bearish momentum could be aggravated by those factors. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $64,500, down almost 8% in a month.Share this articleDon’t have an account? Create oneAlready have an account? Sign InSign In"

Circle Snags First Stablecoin License Under EU's New MiCA Rules,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/07/01/stablecoin-issuer-circle-snags-mica-compliant-emi-license-for-europe/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"01 July 2024 15:30, UTC-","Circle became the first global stablecoin issuer to secure an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license, a prerequisite to offering dollar- and euro-pegged crypto tokens in the European Union (EU) under the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework.The license gives the company, whose USDC trails behind rival Tether's market-leading USDT, pole position in grabbing market share among the 27-nation trading bloc's 450 million people.Stablecoins are a key piece of infrastructure in the digital asset market, facilitating trading on exchanges and, increasingly, used for transactions and remittances. Circle's $32 billion USDC is the second-largest stablecoin and the gap to market leader Tether's $110 billion USDT has been widening.Armed with a license from the French banking regulatory authority, Circle Mint France will “onshore” the issuance of its euro-denominated EURC stablecoin to the EU and issue USDC from the same entity, the company said. Before MiCA's stablecoin rules took effect on June 30, some crypto exchanges delisted euro-denominated stablecoins, such as Tether’s EURT.MiCA’s comprehensive stance on stablecoins was catalyzed by the specter of big tech, like Meta's Diem (formerly Libra) initiative, entering financial markets. That prompted five years of concerted policy development in Europe, said Circle’s head of policy, Dante Disparte, who was involved in the Libra project.“Personally, I feel a little bit of a semi-parental relationship with MiCA because in some ways it was accelerated by my prior life and my prior project, Libra Diem,” Disparate said in an interview. “MiCA is both vindicating of the industry and its permanence, but it's also clear that there is no more shortcuts, at least not in the third-largest economy in the world. Gone are the days where you could operate in a regulatory haven or in the shadows and then expect to have liberal and free access to consumers and market participants.”Read more: EU's Restrictive Stablecoin Rules Take Effect Soon and Issuers Are Running Out of TimeUPDATE (July 1, 15:15 UTC): Adds stablecoin utility, relative market caps of USDC, USDT in third paragraph.Edited by Sheldon Reback.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

Bitcoin Price Prediction for July: WIll BTC Recover?,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-for-july-will-btc-recover/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"01 July 2024 10:37, UTC-","Will Bitcoin’s price recover in July? Let’s have a look at this interesting price prediction. The month of June was a tumultuous one for the Bitcoin price as it brought quite a lot of volatility.Unfortunately, the price action was resolved to the downside, and the bears managed to push it down by 7.12%.Will July be different?With June behind our backs, it’s worth noting that Bitcoin went on a complete rollercoaster during the past 30 days, soaring to as much as $72,000 and dropping to a low of slightly more than $58,000.That said, the sellers were ultimately victorious, pushing the price down by about 7% in total.But will things change in July? Well, according to the popular analyst Ali Charts on X, July is traditionally a strong month for Bitcoin.Historically, when Bitcoin has had a negative June, it tends to bounce back strongly in July. In fact, BTC has shown an average return of 7.98% and a median return of 9.6% during this month.If the last hours are any indication of how the month will go, then the above seems to be true.Bitcoin’s price increased by 4% over the past day, currently trading at around $63,200. This has also pushed its weekly performance in the green by about 1.6%.Naturally, this has put many short positions underwater, with liquidations for the past 24 hours standing at $106 million, with around 85% of them being sellers.

MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor Reacts to Bitcoin Price Lull
Tomiwabold Olajide


As the market continues to navigate through periods of dull action, Saylor's vision for Bitcoin represents a rallying cry with interest and trading activity expected to return.Bitcoin dominated the news at the start of 2024 when the first U.S. spot ETFs for the largest digital asset went live. ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity garnered substantial inflows, pushing Bitcoin to a record high of $73,798 in March, although demand and pricing have since cooled.The Bitcoin price remains locked in a wide range. Following last Monday's plunge to lows of $58,414, bulls have worked tirelessly to keep Bitcoin above $60,000. This is a favorable indication since it indicates that bulls might be buying the Bitcoin decline.As reported, over 20,200 BTC, worth $1.23 billion, were sent to accumulation addresses in a single day, suggestive of dip buying.

Julian Assange Is Now Free: Here’s What He Believes About Bitcoin,https://cryptopotato.com/julian-assange-is-now-free-heres-what-he-believes-about-bitcoin/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"30 June 2024 02:04, UTC-","The free speech advocate has long supported Bitcoin as a way of ensuring history can’t be rewritten.Free speech champions across the world celebrated earlier this week as Julian Assange – founder of WikiLeaks – was finally released from a UK prison after five years behind bars.During his more than decade-long legal battle to escape persecution from multiple national governments, Assange often leaned on crypto to drive global fundraising campaigns to secure his freedom. A newly resurfaced video from years before Assange’s arrest shows him praising cryptocurrencies as a powerful tool for freedom.In the September 2014 clip shared by MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, Assange calls Bitcoin the “most interesting intellectual development on the internet” since the network’s inception in 2009.“A lot of people who have heard about Bitcoin don’t really understand it,” he said at the time. “It is a currency that’s cryptographically backed and multi-jurisdictional, which means it’s very hard for any one power group…to start turning it into a rent-seeking apparatus.”Years after this speech, countries like El Salvador and companies like Strike have begun leveraging Bitcoin as a tool for sending and receiving cheap, instant global remittances.Moreover, Bitcoin and crypto have become leading tools for easily funding global humanitarian movements, including Ukraine’s military defense against Russia or Israel’s support for victims of Hamas.Yet this isn’t even one of Bitcoin’s primary benefits, according to Assange. One of the network’s best qualities, he said, is its ability to “defend itself or the people who use it against even the full might of a superpower.”“The other underlying basic technology is proof of publication at a particular time,” he continued. With Bitcoin’s blockchain operating a ledger of true events that cannot be altered, he argued that the network can “break Orwell’s dictum” arguing that “he who controls the present controls the past.”Indeed, Bitcoin has been used repeatedly as a tool for bypassing sanctions placed by national governments – for better or for worse. In 2022, the Canadian Trucker convoy protesting nationwide vaccine mandates turned to Bitcoin to raise funds when traditional payment platforms like GoFundMe blocked donations.Assange himself turned to crypto for funding after being jailed in the United Kingdom, including over $54 million in ETH through AssangeDAO.“That’s the big expansion we’re about to see in Bitcoin – it all derives form this basic premise,” concluded Assange. “You can prove a particular contract happened at a particular time, globally.”
											Andrew is a content writer with a passion for Bitcoin. He became familiar with Bitcoin back in 2013, but began diligently studying the blockchain technology and its economic implications in 2017.

He wrote that in a tweet published at the start of the week.During a video podcast, he clarified that BTC is very close to hitting $1 million, and it may happen this year or next. Even if it does not happen in 2025, he said, this price jump is still bound to take place soon.

Samson Mow Doubles Down on His $1 Million Bitcoin (BTC) Prediction
Yuri Molchan


Mow has been talking about Bitcoin’s high chances of reaching this impressive price level since the year started and the SEC greenlit exchange-traded funds that track the spot BTC price. Eleven major funds, including BlackRock, VanEck, Ark Invest and Grayscale, filed to launch these ETFs last year.Once the permission was granted, these ETFs started absorbing all the Bitcoin they could see, and they bought more than 10,000 BTC every day between the ETF approval and the BTC halving that occurred on April 19.These regular Bitcoin purchases by ETFs and the diminishing of the Bitcoin block reward led Mow to expect that BTC is about to skyrocket to $1 million soon. He explained this prediction, saying that there is a great Bitcoin demand shock now thanks to the ETFs, and a massive supply shock due to the halving. Once these two BTC shocks collide with each other, they will make Bitcoin skyrocket, he said.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed here are not investment advice; they are provided for informational purposes only.

"Bitcoin Price Prediction: No Confirmation Of Bullish Reversal, Major Crash To $56k On Cards",https://coinpedia.org/news/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-no-confirmation-of-bullish-reversal-major-crash-to-56k-on-cards/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"29 June 2024 04:50, UTC-","Writer by choice, CryptoCurrency Writer, and Researcher by chance. Currently, focusing on financial news and analysis, as well as cryptocurrency news and data. One may not call me a crypto “Enthusiast” but trust me I'm getting there.Analyst Josh of Crypto World took to his latest analysis and revealed that Bitcoin is still showing a short-term bearish signal, repeating its past price movements. He said that over the last day, nothing major has changed.Examining the daily Bitcoin chart, he saw that the DXY (U.S. Dollar Index) is trending upwards, forming higher lows and highs, indicating a bullish trend for the DXY but bearish for Bitcoin in the short term. This pattern has been consistent since Bitcoin was around $67,000. When the DXY trends upwards, it usually means bearish momentum for Bitcoin, and vice versa.Currently, the short-term trend for Bitcoin remains bearish. It hasn’t confirmed any bullish trend reversal yet. However, during this bearish trend, we might see small bounces or sideways consolidations. Over the past few days, he has anticipated a break or relief from the bearish trend for the remainder of the week, which seems to be playing out.In the short term, Bitcoin’s price action has been following a pattern: a slight move down before the weekend, flat price action over the weekend, and increased volatility as the new week begins. This has been consistent over the past few weeks.If Bitcoin closes below $60,000, the next significant support level is between $56,000 and $58,000. Breaking below $56,000 could spell trouble for the larger time frames. For resistance, we have key levels at $63,000 to $64,000 and $67,000 to $68,000, with additional resistance at $72,000 to $74,000.The analyst also saw a small move down before the weekend, which has been a recurring pattern. Over the weekend, the price might see flat, low-volatility price action, followed by increased volatility next week.Lastly, he said to keep an eye on Bitcoin’s liquidation levels. There’s significant liquidity around $60,300 to $60,400 and $62,500, with substantial short position liquidations at $63,700 to $63,900 and $65,000.Read Also: Altcoins Almost 100% Away From Previous ATHs; What Does This Indicate?

Its shares will be valued on a daily basis using prices drawn from trading platforms selected by MarketVector. Investors will be able to get access to the red-hot altcoin through shares that are held in a traditional brokerage account. This eliminates potential risks that are associated with holding the token directly.

Bitcoin's Double Top Suggests BTC Could Fall to $50K: Analyst,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/06/24/bitcoins-double-top-suggests-btc-could-fall-to-50k-analyst/?utm_source=CryptoNews&utm_medium=app,"24 June 2024 07:34, UTC-","Bitcoin (BTC) has carved out a double-top price pattern, signaling a potential bearish trend change ahead of key data release that could influence the Fed's interest rate path.Bitcoin's price journey has been a rollercoaster this month. After surging to nearly $70,000, approaching the all-time high of March, it has now retreated to $63,000, decoupling from Nasdaq's continued move higher, largely due to faster selling by miners, profit-taking by investors near lifetime highs, and outflows from the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds.The price action has formed a double top, a bearish technical analysis pattern comprising two peaks with a valley in the middle, usually appearing after a notable uptrend. The second peak represents uptrend exhaustion, with the eventual breach of the low hit between the two peaks confirming a bearish trend change.""Technically, bitcoin appears to follow a double top formation, whereas the support level is being tested. This chart formation should be our base case unless it becomes invalidated. This formation could easily see a drop to $50,000—if not $45,000,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said.""Yes, the U.S. election and CPI should be bullish later this year, but we can still have a steeper correction,"" Thielen added.However, the Fed's preferred inflation yardstick, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for May, is expected to show the slowest monthly advance in the core figure in over three years. That would cement the case for renewed Fed rate cuts from September, potentially putting a floor under risk assets, including bitcoin.""[Recent] Strong economic data has forced [bond] yields higher and precious metals lower on Friday. This continues to stand in the way of digital hard assets like crypto,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in the weekly newsletter shared with CoinDesk.""This week we have multiple Fed Governors speaking, GDP and most importantly PCE on Friday (the Fed’s favorite inflation indicator),"" Magadini added.Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect no change in the PCE price index and a meager 0.1% uptick in the core PCE, amounting to 2.6% annual advances in both the headline and core figures. The projected core increase, excluding food and energy, would be the smallest since March 2021.Edited by Parikshit Mishra.DisclosurePlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated.CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.
