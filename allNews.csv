However, this correction seems like a large one and was a much-awaited correction. With BTC recovering from $32k to $40k, the altcoins in the market have also been noting a strong recovery on the charts.Polkadot [DOT], VeChain [VET], and Solana [SOL] were among the cryptocurrencies that were holding strong and moving higher.Polkadot [DOT]Source: DOTUSD on TradingViewThe strong dump in the Polkadot market pushed its price from $40 to $18. However, this drop was only momentary and the crypto bounced back above $26. At the time of writing, DOT was trading at $28.26. The token was moving within a restricted range of $26.52 and $29.68, while volatility exited the market.The Bollinger Bands saw the inflated period of volatility converge to indicate the reduced movement of the token. The Signal line dropped under the candlesticks, a development suggesting that the price was moving at a higher level, even within the current range. Meanwhile, the buying pressure was rising as the Relative Strength Index was pushed to 47 from 30. This implied that even though DOT was oversold during the dump, traders saw this as an opportunity to buy the dip.Finally, the Awesome Oscillator suggested that momentum was on the rise and could help the price hold on to its value.VeChain [VET]Source: VETUSD on TradingViewVeChain’s price broke down after a long time. It had held on to the support at $0.14, however, it dropped to as low as $0.0463. As the market went into recovery mode, VET’s price bounced back above $0.0906 as it established soft support. The digital asset was trading at $0.1257, at press time, and could test resistance at $0.1334.The volatility remained low, at the time of press, as the Bollinger Bands converged. This recovery pushed the price on an upwards trend and the Signal line moved under the candlesticks suggesting a bullish movement. Rising buying pressure also helped the price move higher.The Relative Strength Index suggested that after dropping well under the oversold zone, VET had returned to above this zone. With buyers showing interest in buying the asset, the RSI value had shot to 51. This was a sign of a stable market, while the money also remained within the market.Solana [SOL]Source: SOLUSD on TradingViewSolana‘s price recently tested the resistance at $42.65, but failed to surpass it. At the time of press, SOL was trading at $42.28 and trying to push past its resistance. The bullishness in the market might help the digital asset to move past this point.The Bollinger Bands suggested that volatility was significant in the SOL market. As the price dropped the second time after testing the resistance, it formed a support level at $39.14. As the price consolidated at this level, the Signal line dropped under the candlesticks and marked an upwards trend for the SOL token. Meanwhile, the buyers have been dominating the market as the Relative Strength Index hit 52, which was a little above the equilibrium level.This bullish momentum clubbed with the MACD’s bullish signal pointed to SOL’s move above $42.65.Sign Up For Our  NewsletterWhat do recent market corrections say about ‘Ethereum killers?’ICP, MATIC, WAVES – Which of these alts can lead the recovery phase?Namrata is a full-time journalist at AMBCrypto covering the US and Indian market.

Free Cloud Mining Providers to Mine Bitcoin in 2021 Bitcoin (BTC) has bounced at the $30,000 support area. 

Ethereum (ETH) has been decreasing since reaching a high of ₿0.085.XRP (XRP) is trading inside an ascending parallel channel.

Reserve Rights (RSR) has bounced at the $0.031 support area.Kava.io (KAVA) could potentially begin a 1-2/1-2 wave formation.The Graph (GRT) is trading inside a descending parallel channel.Dash (DASH) has bounced at the $190 support area.BTC decreased considerably yesterday, falling all the way to a low of $30,000. However, it has bounced since, and created a long lower wick, with a magnitude of 22%. Despite the bounce, technical indicators do not yet provide any bullish reversal signs. The main resistance levels are found at $41,430 and $48,330. It is possible that BTC will consolidate for a period of time.ETH/BTC has been moving downwards since May 15, when it reached a high of ₿0.082. The high was made very close to the long-term ₿0.085 resistance area. It is probable that it was the top of wave three (black).It reached the 0.382 Fib retracement support level at ₿0.0612 before bouncing. However, it is possible that it will potentially complete a fourth wave pullback at the 0.5 or even the 0.618 Fib retracement support levels at ₿0.056 and ₿0.0496, respectively. This would complete a fourth wave pullback.XRP/BTC has been falling since reaching a high of 3,903 satoshis on May 19. However, it managed to bounce, once reaching the support line of an ascending parallel channel.It is possible that this is a running flat correction, especially since waves A:C had a 1:1 ratio. If so, the price would be expected to increase at least to the 4,200 satoshi resistance area and potentially the 0.382 Fib retracement level resistance at 4,880 satoshis.RSR has been moving downwards since April 16, when it reached an all-time high price of $0.119. The decrease accelerated once the token broke down below the $0.0695 area. On May 19, it managed to reach a low of $0.021.However, it has bounced since, creating a lower wick with a magnitude of 95%.This validated the $0.031 area as support. The area previously acted as resistance in Auust. 2020 (red icon), before being validated as support in February 2021. The main resistance area is found at $0.0695, the level which previously acted as support.DASH has been decreasing since reaching a high of $478 on May 7. Yesterday, it reached a low of $140.73, before bouncing. However, the bounce has been weak relative to other altcoins, with the lower wick being only 35%.Nevertheless, the token has reclaimed the $190 area, validating it as support. This is the third touch of the level, the previous two occurring in February and March, respectively.The closest resistance levels are found at $270 and $310, respectively.KAVA has been moving downwards since April 5. On May 19, it reached a low of $2.07, nearly touching a support line that has been in place since March 2020. Besides it, there is no discernible pattern in place. However, the support line is drawn connecting the lows of wave one and two (white). Since the line is still intact, it still allows for the possibility that the movement is a massive 1-2/1-2 wave formation, which would likely lead to an explosive breakout.GRT has been decreasing alongside a descending parallel channel since Feb. 12, when it reached an all-time high price of $2.88. On May 19, it reached a low of $0.52, before bouncing. The bounce coincided with the support line of the channel and the 0.786 Fib retracement level of the most recent upward movement.Since then, it has reclaimed the $0.73 level, potentially validating it as support.The area previously acted as resistance in December 2020. Therefore, it is a suitable spot for the initiation of a bounce.For BeInCrypto’s latest bitcoin (BTC) analysis, click here.Valdrin is a cryptocurrency enthusiast and financial trader.

FIL Price Analysis: Filecoin downtrend exhibits exhaustion after 200 EMA swoops in as support,https://www.thecoinrepublic.com/2021/05/20/fil-price-analysis-filecoin-downtrend-exhibits-exhaustion-after-200-ema-swoops-in-as-support/,05-20,"The daily chart of FIL dictated a bearish trend for the token long before BTC’s vulnerability on Wednesday. The digital asset was exposed to the wrath of bears from the moment it broke out towards the downside from the ascending triangle pattern. FIL is currently trading at a low of 62% from its ATH of $236 which was established on April 1st of this year. The asset then continued to sink while maintaining a lethargic momentum. The bearish breakout from the ascending triangle pattern invalided the anticipation of a massive bull flag.  The price action of FIL is now wrapped inside a bearish continuation pattern called the descending parallel channel. In accordance with pivot points, a break above the resistance of $169 would accommodate the price action to escape from the channel and revisit its ATH. At present, FIL is perfectly compressed between the 100 EMA(green) and 200 EMA(white) whereas the 200 EMA was disclosed as a major support level in yesterday’s massive selloff. The strong selling pressure has led the weekly chart forming three black crows. This particular pattern usually announces an upcoming price reversal which justifies the fact that recovery is imminent. The 4-hour chart of FIL forecasts a minor pullback for FIL as evidenced by the red candlestick disrupting today’s uptrend. FIL has successfully tacked the $77 (FIB 0.236) and is currently aiming for a rebound from that particular level.However, a decisive close below this range could expose FIL to retest the $48 level. In that case, the price action would reveal a potential double bottom pattern which would make the momentum healthier. The CVIX of FIL is flashing 72 which means that traders must be prepared for colossal price fluctuationsThe MACD (bullish) has recently transpired a bullish crossover which is confirmed by the accelerating histogram at press time.The RSI (bullish) on the daily chart is exhibiting signs of reversal and is gradually heading towards the equilibrium range. Fileocin had gone through a place shift by crossing its Network Baseline, and now block rewards that can be used for building capacity are now being distributed at full speed. Filecoin later added that by the implementation of such activities, they will a sustainable transition to the stage where their network has a strong reputation and a suite of projects over a wide range of markets. SUPPORT : $48, $77RESISTANCE: $145, $183 How useful was this post?

Green Investments Help Bitcoin Miners Amid Possible Regulatory Crackdown,https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/green-investments-help-bitcoin-miners-amid-possible-regulato-10356.htm,05-20,"Follow us on Twitter or join our TelegramRegulators have been moving into multiple areas of the crypto industry, and they will – in one way or another – come after crypto mining powered by non-renewables, according to two miners that talked with Cryptonews.com.However, as the concerns, facts, and misinformation over Bitcoin (BTC)’s carbon footprint have reemerged during this cycle, mining companies that have been moving towards cleaner energy sources seem to be more prepared ahead of possible new mining-related regulations. Igor Runets, CEO and Founder of BitRiver, a major provider of colocation services for cryptocurrency mining in Russia, and the CIS, noted that countries across the world are already moving towards carbon neutrality, so it’s to be expected that there’ll be regulations discouraging non-renewable powered crypto mining, directly or indirectly. As for Greenidge Generation, a US-based vertically integrated BTC mining and power generation facility, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Tim Rainey said that the company will continue working with regulatory agencies and government at all levels, given that they all share a goal – an environmentally-sound, economically-vital operation. As a power producer, “Greenidge is one of very few cryptocurrency mining companies with extensive experience” working with regulators on this matter, Rainey said, adding that “by design, the Bitcoin mining algorithm forces all miners to pursue best efficiency in energy use.” In 2017, Greenidge converted their power plant from a coal-fired one to “a cleaner and greener natural gas-powered one.” Moreover, they have recently made a commitment to make their Upstate New York mining operation completely carbon-neutral starting with June 1 this year and “forever thereafter.”In March, the company said that its 106 MW natural gas plant powers 19 MW of mining capacity, which is expected to more than double to 41 MW by the end of Q2 2021 and reach 85 MW by the end of 2022.Meanwhile, also in 2017, BitRiver started their business in the “hydropower-rich Siberian region” in Russia – chosen specifically due to the belief “that the future of cryptocurrency mining will be powered by renewables,” said Runets. For him, committing to sustainable mining from the very start was a “far-sighted decision,” proven by the increased concern among institutions and investors regarding Bitcoin’s carbon footprint. This heightened concern, however, was good for BitRiver’s business, the CEO suggested, saying that “this shift has not only resulted in even higher demand for our low-carbon colocation services, but also strengthened our belief in the future of cryptocurrency mining.”Their facility currently has over 100 MW of power capacity fully operational, but it is in the process of increasing this capacity to 300 MW by the end of 2021. This will be done through datacenters that are currently at various stages of development, said Runets. Also, BitRiver launched the BTR utility token, which is backed by 100 MW of low-carbon power in the datacenter in Siberia’s city of Bratsk. BTR is meant to “accelerate our plans and make it easier for miners and investors around the world to access our low-carbon cryptocurrency mining services,” said the CEO.Additionally, there's another change expected in the crypto mining business, as the second-largest network by market capitalization, Ethereum (ETH), plans to move from its current proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, used by Bitcoin too, to proof-of-stake (PoS). BitTriver and Greenidge say it won't affect their business in a noticeable way. While the US company has ""a small test mining operation"" where they mine a small amount of ETH and other cryptoassets, BitRiver sees stronger demand for ETH mining as the move to PoS nears and as Ethereum becomes more profitable to mine than ever. “On the other hand, the demand from clients who want to mine other popular PoW blockchains such as Bitcoin already exceeds our current or planned capacity,” Runets said.

Last year, Sorare created Ethereum-based tokens representing MLS players, but through a partnership with the MLS Players Association, not the league.MLS is also clearly monitoring concerns over NFTs and the environment.

However, the consistent volatility in the market has been challenging for the market to hold on to this value.At the time of press, the value of XRP was marked between its immediate support at $0.90 and its immediate resistance at $1.66. With the market stabilizing from yesterday’s fall, XRP may work t0 test these immediate levels, depending on the direction of Bitcoin’s market.ReasoningThe fall in volatility was visible with the convergence of the Bollinger Bands. After noting a long period of volatility earlier this month, the bands had compressed and remained parallel to each other. This suggested that the XRP market may not be seeing as much volatility as before. As the volatility remained low, the Signal line moved above the price bars and underlined the depreciating value.Further, selling pressure in the market has prevailed since the sell-off. The Relative Strength Index which managed to bounce between the oversold and overbought zones for a long time was going to drop under the oversold zone. However, the recovering price pushed the indicator higher, with the same noting a value of 43 – trying to reach equilibrium.However, despite the added pressure from the buyers, the XRP market remained bearish due to the price drop. Momentum was escaping the market, especially since money was starting to flow out of the market after almost a month.Crucial levels to watch out forEntry-level: $1.1781
Take profit: $1.7383
Stop-level: $0.9020
Risk to Reward: 2.03ConclusionThe XRP market, at the time of writing, pointed to the presence of bears and bulls in the market. Although the sudden drop in its value gave way to the bears, buyers have been keeping the market in profit. There could be an effort from the buyers to push the value of XRP higher up the charts to the resistance level of $1.66.Sign Up For Our  NewsletterIs the worst over for the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum?What do recent market corrections say about ‘Ethereum killers?’Namrata is a full-time journalist at AMBCrypto covering the US and Indian market.

Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo Become First F1 Teams to Launch Crypto Tokens,https://beincrypto.com/aston-martin-and-alfa-romeo-become-first-f1-teams-to-launch-crypto-tokens/,27 m-,"We use cookies to improve your experience.Lost or forgotten your password? Please enter your email ddress. You will receive mail with link to set new password.Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo F1 teams reportedly become the first to offer fan tokens. The fan tokens are provided by Socios and can be bought with CHZ. Socios recently signed a deal with Rousch Fenway Racing to sell tokens to NASCAR fans. Free Cloud Mining Providers to Mine Bitcoin in 2021 Formula One (F1) teams from Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo had a photo finish today, with both announcing the launch of crypto fan tokens on the Socios.com platform. 

Formula 1 teams owned by Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo have reportedly become the first Formula to launch cryptocurrency fan tokens. The pair join fellow European sports teams such as FC Barca, Manchester City, Paris Sait-Germain, and AC Milan in offering fan tokens. As of Thursday, tokens will be available to be purchased and offer owners the opportunity to be part of the team in some small ways. Ownership of these tokens allows fans to take part in the voting decisions, earn additional VIP rewards, and be offered exclusive promotions. As with many crypto tokens, they may also be traded on participating crypto exchanges. 

The tokens not only offer fans the chance to be a part of their favorite racing teams, but they also provide said teams with an additional revenue stream. Racing teams who sign up for the program will earn a commission for each token sold. Additionally, a share of trading fees, that are incurred from the sale of tokens on Chiliz (CHZ) or any other crypto exchange where the tokens are accepted, go toward funding the racing teams. Socios has been very successful lately finding teams and leagues to get on board with their fan token program. As it stands, traders must first acquire assets in the crypto CHZ. Then, fans use those assets to purchase fan tokens, which are fully fungible digital assets living on the Chiliz blockchain. Both CHZ and the fan tokens themselves use the ERC20 token standard. The fan tokens are team-specific and each team can only offer a finite supply of them. They never expire and, since they are fungible, they can be traded freely against CHZ. Socios and Chilz CEO Alexandre Dreyfus said about the ability for teams to earn from these tokens. “In 2020, as a company, we sold more than $30 million of tokens for all of our partners. And because more or less we were on a 50/50 basis, it means that the clubs generated more than $15 million in total. There are some clubs that got more than $5 million each, which, in the COVID-19 world, is very good fresh money, and very much welcome for them.”Dreyfus went on to talk about how the popularity of these tokens in F1 and other sports is the beginning of a new era. “In the next few years, a generation of passive fans will shift into active fans. That transition will take place through transaction fan engagement on our platform,” he said.The company has been doing well bringing in teams from the racing world. The F1 announcement comes just a week after Socios found their first racing client with NASCAR’s Roush Fenway Racing Team. Matthew De Saro is a journalist and media personality specializing in sports, gambling, and statistics.

Holoride to Deploy Elrond Blockchain and NFTs in Its Ecosystem,https://btcmanager.com/holoride-elrond-blockchain-nft-ecosystem/,24 m-,"Audi-backed startup Holoride has announced that it is deploying blockchain technology for its immersive media platform. The platform also underlined its mission to expand into blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFT). Holoride revealed this development in a press release on May 20, 2021. The startup also stated that it would be integrating Elrond blockchain into its tech system to leverage the highly secure, immutable, and decentralized characteristics of blockchain technology. It further added that the choice of Elrond was due to their commitment and strong innovation roadmap that fits with Holoride’s vision. The integration of Elrond blockchain is intended to improve transparency in the distribution of revenue among partners and offer a unique passenger experience for users. Holoride is building the first in-vehicle media platform and adding blockchain technology would allow the platform to add unique features like NFTs and social currencies to improve the passenger experience. NFTs have emerged as a unique form of token that has extended the application of blockchain technology and tokenization towards entertainment. Holoride intends to use NFTs as a means to incentivize developers to create more products within its ecosystem. The use case of NFTs will also be extended to attract passengers that desire a personalized experience. The NFTs in the Holoride ecosystem will contain specific attributes that will allow developers to retain the value of their creations. Also, digital items and collectibles on the Holoride platform are intended to be tradable and transferable. This, according to Holoride, will unlock unprecedented experience and commercial value within the in-car entertainment space. Holoride is backed by car manufacturing giant Audi and recently completed Series A funding in April, which raised $12 million. Nils Wollny, CEO and co-founder of Holoride, believes that integrating blockchain and NFTs is important. “As we look to expand across global markets, blockchain technology and NFTs help us scale while securing the integrity of our developer-centric and car manufacturer-agnostic approach,He also added that Holoride was looking to provide a unique experience and opportunity for users via NFTs. “Our mission is to make transit time more valuable for everyone. Through NFTs, we envision the highest level of personalization for users while offering a one-of-a-kind XR experience with compelling monetization opportunities for our partners,” he concluded. AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement

You will receive mail with link to set new password.Bitcoin continues to suffer in light of Chinese authorities forbidding banks from engaging with cryptocurrencies.Gold meanwhile continued its upwards momentum from last weekThe stock prices of MicroStrategy and Square struggled similarly to BTC, while AT&T had a notable sell-off.Free Cloud Mining Providers to Mine Bitcoin in 2021 This week’s price movements for bitcoin (BTC), gold, and our stock picks MicroStrategy, Square, and AT&T.

Bitcoin’s struggles keep continuing. After dropping below $50,000 in light of Tesla announcing it would no longer be accepting bitcoin, the price struggled around that level the next two days, before taking another hit on May 16. At that point, it fell even lower testing support twice at $42,000, before stabilizing around $45,000.However on May 19, BTC plummeted to $30,000, its lowest point since January 2021. Buying pressure returned at that point, pushing it back above $40,000. BTC is currently trading around $42,000.

Although BTC’s initial fall can almost certainly be attributed to Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s announcement, he is also the likely cause of its further fall on May 16. When a Twitter user speculated that Tesla would “dump the rest of their bitcoin holdings,” Musk implied that this could be the case by replying, “Indeed.”This triggered BTC’s fall to $42,000, until Musk decided “to clarify speculation,” saying, “Tesla has not sold any bitcoin,” when it stabilized at $45,000. BTC bottoming out on May 19 is largely speculated to have been caused by Chinese authorities banning financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions.While BTC suffered, gold prospered. After rising overall the week prior, gold continued with its upwards momentum. From May 13 going into the weekend on May 14, gold’s price rose from $1,810 to $1,845. It floated around $1,850 on May 17, before shooting up around noon past $1,865.It then hovered around $1,870 the next two days, before falling to $1,855. However, at that point, it sprang up to $1,890, before cooling off to $1,865. It is currently trading just above $1,875. Overall, gold was fuelled by a dip in the dollar and U.S. yields as investors shrugged off the Federal Reserve’s hints on possible tapering of economic support measures.Minutes from the Fed on May 19 were “effectively the first introduction of official talk of tapering. […] Gold is up driven by the fact that we’ve seen yields and the dollar reverse a little bit,” said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities. “The view out there is though the Fed was talking about tapering, in reality, it’s very unlikely that we’re going to have an imminent reduction in monetary accommodation.”Like most stocks strongly associated with bitcoin, MicroStrategy (MSTR) is trading similarly. Since its earning report on April 30, the stock has steadily fallen in fits and starts. From $630 on April 30, it fell to $600 by May 4, pushing back to $640 by May 5.It fell again to $600 the next day, before recovering to $620 the day after. However, on May 10, the stock fell far past $600 to $560. Although it rose back to $680 the next day, the downward trend continued and it had fallen below $500 by May 13.It struggled to maintain that level over the past week, but dropped sharply, like BTC, on May 19, to just about $400. It has recovered somewhat and is now trading around $480.Despite bitcoin’s slide, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor remains dedicated to his company’s BTC strategy. Although the gradual dip of the company’s stock can be attributed to its association with BTC, the MSTR still retains fourfold of its value a year prior. “Entities I control have now acquired 111,000 BTC and have not sold a single satoshi,” Saylor tweeted. “Bitcoin Forever.”Similarly, Square’s (SQ) association with BTC has seen it take a hit recently. Despite gapping up to $240 after its latest earnings report on May 7, SQ has steadily fallen since then. By May 10, it was trading around $220. It subsequently fell further, and by May 13, had fallen below $200. However, it has channeled between $192 and $208 since then and is currently trading around $205.After losing $20 million on its $220 million investment in the cryptocurrency during the first quarter of this year, Square announced that they would be halting any further purchases of BTC. Square’s CFO Amrita Ahuja told the Financial News in an interview, “We don’t have any plans at this point to make further purchases. There’s no plans at this point to re-evaluate where we are from a treasury standpoint.”Although AT&T (T) had been rising marginally since its latest earning report on April 21, it lost those gains and more on May 17. Gapping up to $31.50 after the earnings report, it fell below $31, by April 27. However, it pushed steadily upwards from there reaching nearly $32.50 by May 6.On May 10, the stock jumped to $32.75, before falling back to $32 over the next week. But the stock gapped up significantly to $33.50 on May 17, before selling off to $31.50. It gapped down significantly the next day to below $30, where it is now trading.The stock sold off after AT&T announced a deal to shed its media assets, combining them with Discovery, and focus on its 5G and fiber-internet telecom core. That strategic refocus was seen as a positive by investors and analysts. However, it comes at the cost of a dividend cut after the proposed spinoff closes. The deal will provide AT&T with $43 billion in cash and other assets to pay down debt. Nick is a data scientist who teaches economics and communication in Budapest, Hungary, where he received a BA in Political Science and Economics and an MSc in Business Analytics from CEU.

Bitcoin (BTC) was hovering around $40,000 after losing some of the gains from a forceful rebound earlier Thursday. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at one point surged as high as $43,000, regaining almost all of the ground lost during Wednesday’s 14% price plunge, which was the biggest single-day decline in 14 months.       Shortly after 16:00 coordinated universal time (12 p.m. ET), bitcoin dropped about 5%. That move roughly coincided with the publication of a U.S. Treasury report calling for businesses that receive transfers of more than $10,000 in cryptocurrencies to report them to the Internal Revenue Service. “There are definitely still some downside risks left short term, and markets rarely rebound in one single move up,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner of investment firm Tellurian Capital. “Political noise, with news of tax rules tightening, is still weighing on a prompt recovery.”Bitcoin’s rebound came as U.S. stocks rallied on positive economic news, while the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds declined by four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.63%.

California Bank Could Soon Bring Bitcoin to Its Customers,https://dailyhodl.com/2021/05/20/california-bank-could-soon-bring-bitcoin-to-its-customers/,18 m-,"A community bank in California may be boarding the Bitcoin bandwagon.Suncrest Bank is in talks with regulators and financial technology companies to allow its customers to buy, hold and sell Bitcoin.Suncrest CEO Ciaran McMullan told the Sacramento Business Journal that the bank is acting on customer interest.Says McMullan,“The pandemic has had an impact on the acceptance and migration to digital.”Bitcoin, which is down more than 40% from its record high in April, has been on a dramatic plunge downward amid concerns that China will implement harsh crypto bans, and that Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla would stop accepting Bitcoin as payment due to its environmental impact.Instead, Suncrest is in discussions with NYDIG Trust Company LLC, a Bitcoin-focused financial services and technology provider, and Fidelity National Information Services Inc. (FIS), to create a platform that will allow banks to offer the ability to buy, sell and hold Bitcoin in bank accounts.Suncrest has $1.3 billion in assets under management and seven locations throughout central California, including Fresno, Kingsburg, Lodi, Porterville, West Sacramento, Visalia and Yuba City.Suncrest could offer Bitcoin to bank customers this year or in 2022.

Deutsche Bank Analyst Channels Karl Lagerfeld in Scathing Review of Bitcoin,https://beincrypto.com/deutsche-bank-analyst-channels-karl-lagerfeld/,17 m-,"We use cookies to improve your experience.Lost or forgotten your password? Please enter your email ddress. You will receive mail with link to set new password.Deutsche Bank analyst is pessimistic on bitcoin's future.Bitcoin fell on Wednesday, but recovered throughout Thursday.Bitcoin's environmental issues have been brought to mainstream attention.Free Cloud Mining Providers to Mine Bitcoin in 2021 Deutsche Bank analyst and Harvard University lecturer Marion Laboure, quoted the late Karl Lagerfeld Wednesday when she said:

“It took bitcoin (BTC) a mere three months to go from trendy to tacky, and all it took for the cryptocurrency to fall out of style was one tweet and a Chinese government statement.” This statement came on the back of Wednesday’s market plunge, which saw bitcoin lose 22% of its value, hitting a three-month low of $32,129.

The world’s biggest cryptocurrency saw recent gains wiped out overnight, taking most all other major cryptocurrencies with it. This has been attributed to negative press from billionaire tweeter Elon Musk, as well as an announcement out of China.China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, announced plans to enforce further restrictions on cryptocurrency trading, this week. These plans are an extension of pre-existing rules from 2017. The news came on the back of rising environmental issues surrounding bitcoin.Bitcoin’s environmental issues have been brought to mainstream attention by Tesla’s CEO. Musk appeared on NBC’s Saturday Night Live two weeks ago, coining himself the “Dogefather.” Dogecoin (DOGE) plummeted in value immediately after this appearance, the avid tweet continued to affect markets after.Tesla announced they would cease accepting payment in bitcoin, only several months after introducing this.Despite the glum prediction that cryptocurrencies had suddenly become passé bitcoin, the rest of the market has recovered today. While Laboure alluded to the possibility of bitcoin continuing to rise and fall, she has glum predictions for its long-term potential.

Som Seif: 'Rational' for SEC to Approve Crypto ETFs,https://www.coindesk.com/som-seif-sec-should-approve-crypto-etfs,16 m-,"Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policySign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyPlease consider using a different web browser for better experience.The founder of Purpose Investments, one of the first companies to offer bitcoin and ether ETFs in North America, chats ahead of Consensus 21. Som Seif was an investment banker with RBC Capital Markets before he founded Claymore Investments, a provider of exchange-traded funds, unit investment trusts and other services, which he sold to BlackRock in 2012. His new company, Purpose Investments, has launched ETFs for bitcoin and ether, attracting more than $12 billion to its bitcoin ETF at the time of writing. Consensus 2021: Som Seif will appear at this year’s CoinDesk’s Consensus conference on May 25, in the “Bitcoin for Advisers” Exploration. Register here.U.S. regulators haven’t approved ETFs for digital assets, much to the annoyance of many investors and crypto investment firms, who believe such vehicles are crucial for more mainstream acceptance of the industry. CoinDesk caught up with Seif ahead of his appearance at Consensus next week. The following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity. CoinDesk: Why do we need a bitcoin ETF as opposed to just investing in bitcoin?This is an important asset class that’s getting more and more demand by all types of investors. But the reality is that, for most investors, it’s a very clunky asset to own. Prior to the launch of the ETFs in bitcoin and ether, investors would have to open up an exchange account or a separate custody account and then execute transactions using a nontraditional brokerage or their own wallets. It’s like how it was with gold in the ’90s and early 2000s, before the gold ETFs came. With ETFs, the assets are available to every investor in the same way that they would normally invest in any other security, in their traditional accounts in a traditional company and tradable like a normal security. For an asset like bitcoin, which is very much supply and demand driven, it will open up the ability to capture much greater demand for the assets in time. It’s like what we saw with gold once the original gold ETFs were launched in 2003 and 2004. The demand function of gold grew exponentially over the next 20 years, and today it’s a core part of many people’s portfolios. My guess is that the SEC will approve it and it will be very rational for them to do so and very irrational for them at this stage not toCoinDesk: How much of a demand increase might we see because of ETFs for bitcoin and ether? Digital assets are a young area. It’s only 11 or 12 years old in terms of kind of knowledge and awareness. For most people, bitcoin has only been growing for the last five years. So it’s got a long way to grow. ETFs give people an easy and secure way to access demand, and it makes people more likely to purchase. People were interested in bitcoin and ether previously, but exchanges and custody create friction. In the institutional world, unless you were going to go through the process of opening up a crypto custody account, most of them didn’t touch this. With normal securities, you understand the structure of things, but digital assets are quite different. You don’t have the back-end settlement structures and the traditional custodians. Because it’s a bearer asset, the security around the asset is an important thing, and it’s very different from securing a stock. With ETFs, all of that goes away because the investment is in a traditional form, and you can have confidence in that structure in the same way as you would have confidence when you’re buying the S&P 500, the Nasdaq or whatever. You can hold it in your traditional custody accounts and you can put a traditional ownership and governance structure around that. CoinDesk: Regulators in the U.S. haven’t approved ETFs for digital assets. Why do you think Canadian regulators have been amenable to these products? Canadian regulators historically have shown a willingness to have a conversation and to be open-minded about innovation. There’s a long history of Canada being first in the investment world and with ETFs. Back in 2017 and 2018, both sets of regulators made the decision not to approve the products, and there were two reasons. One was a question of whether this is a legitimate asset and do we want people to have access to it? There are questions around brokerage, trading and whether there is enough liquidity. The second was, is the infrastructure there to even enable a product like this so there is sufficient liquidity? Is there sufficient market-making capability to ensure efficiency of price? Are there institutional-quality custody solutions from the security and structural perspective? Back then, both regulators made the decision that the market didn’t have enough structure for both of those things. The Canadian regulators made a decision that people are going to want to access this one way or another. We had a couple of examples of unregulated exchanges that ended up being fraudulent, like QuadrigaX. And regulators said we’d much rather give access via a regulated security structure versus an unregulated security structure. [Canadian] regulators said we’d much rather give access via a regulated security structure versus an unregulated security structure. And I think the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) has to ask the same question. Companies like Coinbase and Grayscale are giving investors access to this market. That makes it harder to argue that we shouldn’t give people access to a more efficient structure. The trading fees on Coinbase are ludicrous. You can see in their profits – they are making a lot of money. And my guess is that the SEC will approve it, and it will be very rational for them to do so and very irrational for them at this stage not to. What are your long-term outlooks on bitcoin and ethereum as assets? They are very different assets, and they play very different roles. I’ve been very personally biased towards ethereum in the last few years. My view on bitcoin is it’s purely a supply and demand store of value. We know that supply is limited by a specific structure of inflation every year, we know the inflationary rate of bitcoin. I’m a big believer that over the next number of years, bitcoin will be much higher in price, but it’s hard to argue where it’s going to be in the next six or 12 months. On ether, it has a very different utility. It’s not just about supply and demand. It’s about growth and applications. Bitcoin is ubiquitous and people don’t think of crypto without thinking about bitcoin. With ether, awareness is only starting to grow. As NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and DeFi (decentralized finance) continue to grow, we’ll see more and more people come in, and I think we’ll see significant upside in the next 12 months, perhaps up to $10,000. Over time, I think ether will be the more valuable platform, but it could take a number of years.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

"Two Paths Of A Bitcoin Bull Run, And If A Bear Phase Is Next",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-bull-run-bear-phase/,15 m-,"Bitcoin price has plummeted more than 50% from recent highs, falling to as low as $30,000 in a matter of a flash. The selloff was enough to shock the entire market, causing the most liquidations and coins to be deposited since Black Thursday.There’s now talk of the bull run being over, however, there’s potentially two different paths that the cryptocurrency could take according to the RSI and past bull market performance.After more than one full year of an uptrend, the volatile crypto market wiped out months of progress in days. The sharp reversal caused a 50% drop across the board, and it was enough to spook the market.Related Reading | Bear Phase Fractal Warns Of Pain, Bitcoin Bull Market To Remain UnbrokenSeveral top signals also appeared, such as the Pi Cycle Top indicator, and the Relative Strength Index reaching overbought levels on the monthly. The monthly RSI, however, has been swatted down by bears and back into the normal range of the oscillator.There is also a bearish divergence stretching across past bull cycle tops, which could provide clues as to what’s to come.If bears can close the monthly Relative Strength Index back below overbought levels, then the bull market could be over according to scenario B from 2017. Scenario A, however, shows bull holding the key level, and making another drastic push higher to finish the bull market.In scenario A, the stock-to-flow model should be proven accurate, and the leading cryptocurrency by market cap will head towards hundreds of thousands of dollars per coin.But what if the stock-to-flow model, and every major analyst that’s glanced at a Bitcoin chart is dead wrong about expectations, or something catastrophic happens?  It sounds unrealistic, but nothing is guaranteed in markets – not even the success of Bitcoin.Droves of analysts have produced charts that demonstrate what that path to hundreds of thousands looks like, but what might a devastating collapse look like instead?If a bear market takes place now and with the stock-to-flow model causing expectations to be so high, the short investment horizon of impatient investors could lead to a sharper selloff if BTC isn’t trading at hundreds of thousands before the year’s end.A bull market failure and failure to produce the results investors are expecting, could cause investors to abandoned the cryptocurrency completely. Unless they’re in it for the tech. Forewarning of such an event, is a weak spot in the monthly Ichimoku cloud.Related Reading | Lack Of “Capitulation” Volume Suggests Bitcoin Is Doomed To More DownsideThe monthly price chart in Bitcoin also is forming a massive bearish wedge taking place across nearly a decade. A breakdown could set the trajectory for passing through the Kumo twist, which is a common setup according to how the indicator itself works.And while anyone even remotely bullish on Bitcoin would immediately write this off, there’s no denying the cloud twist is there. Bulls also didn’t see the recent crash coming – could they also be blind to this possibility?

US Treasury Plans to Raise Additional $700B Through New Tax Compliance Measures,https://beincrypto.com/treasury-says-cryptocurrencies-pose-tax-evasion-risk/,14 m-,"We use cookies to improve your experience.Lost or forgotten your password? Please enter your email ddress. You will receive mail with link to set new password.The U.S. Treasury Department has released a report stating they will require any crypto transfer of $10,000 or more to be reported to the IRS.The reports states that ""Cryptocurrency already poses a significant detection problem by facilitating illegal activity broadly including tax evasion.""The plan is to combat illegal activity and shrink the tax gap which is around $600 billion annually. Free Cloud Mining Providers to Mine Bitcoin in 2021 The United States Treasury Department released a statement on Thursday announcing their plans to crack down on tax evasion using cryptocurrency.  The Treasury Department plans to raise an additional $700 billion through the new tax compliance measures. 

In the 22-page report, officials highlighted a number of policies to grow enforcement aimed at combating the expanding tax gap. The tax gap is the calculated difference between what taxpayers are paying and what they actually owe. Currently, the tax gap is around $600 billion annually.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commissioner, however, believes the number could exceed $1 trillion when cryptocurrencies are taken into account. The policies identified include increased reporting requirements, new auditor tools, and new rules specific to cryptocurrencies.

The plan will require any transfer of $10,000 or more will be reported to the IRS and could raise as much as $2 trillion over the next 20 years. Just getting close to closing that gap could be a huge step in funding President Biden’s multi-trillion-dollar spending proposals. Proposals aimed at bettering childcare, manufacturing, and other domestic priorities. In the report, the Treasury Department said:“Cryptocurrency already poses a significant detection problem by facilitating illegal activity broadly including tax evasion. This is why the President’s proposal includes additional resources for the IRS to address the growth of crypto assets. Within the context of the new financial account reporting regime, cryptocurrencies and crypto asset exchange accounts, and payment service accounts that accept cryptocurrencies would be covered. Further, as with cash transactions, businesses that receive crypto assets with a fair market value of more than $10,000 would also be reported on.”In the past, many Wall Street analysts have been warning the public that government regulators at the Treasury and SEC would soon be taking more interest in crypto regulations. Those concerns are now a reality and will add another roadblock for current and future crypto investors. Especially considering the recent market dip. Financial services company, Raymond James, expects it’s only a matter of time until Congress grants the SEC broader jurisdiction to cover digital assets. Especially with Gary Gensler now at the helm. Gensler recently spoke with lawmakers and stated that allowing the SEC to regulate crypto exchanges will help protect investors against market manipulation. Not everyone is confident that Gensler has the investor’s interests in mind, however. Ed Mills, an analyst for Raymond James, wrote that “Chairman Gensler is viewed as a potential ally for cryptocurrencies as a former professor on the topic; however, these statements are likely to revisit debates regarding the regulatory risk to cryptocurrencies and exchanges.” He goes on to say that in the long-term, regulation could add legitimacy to the asset class and provide a “regulatory moat around existing cryptocurrency exchanges.”Matthew De Saro is a journalist and media personality specializing in sports, gambling, and statistics.

Samsung Adds 3rd-Party Crypto Wallet Support,https://cryptonews.com/news/samsung-adds-3rd-party-crypto-wallet-support-10389.htm,13 m-,"Follow us on Twitter or join our TelegramThe electronics giant Samsung has announced that it will allow users of older Galaxy smartphones that do not feature its crypto wallet app – the Samsung Blockchain Keystore – to use hardware wallets. The company also reorganizes its blockchain division and expands the scope of its phones’ crypto services to allow third-party wallet support.The development will essentially allow crypto users to transfer their tokens off their own app and onto hardware wallets.Per Newsis and a post on the Samsung Newsroom, the firm wrote that devices running Android OS 9.0 that do not feature the Samsung Blockchain Keystore app can download an update that will allow them to physically connect hardware wallets to “manage blockchain assets or keys.”The firm stated that Galaxy smartphones can now be connected to hardware wallets from Ledger, beginning with the Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X. The firm was quoted as stating that it was planning to add support for “various” other third-party wallets.The company has previously sought to make much of the fact that its app is underpinned by its secure Knox platform, which protects private keys with fingerprint and password authentication. And Newsis added that Samsung was working to bolster its blockchain team in a bid to “promote the popularization of blockchain technology” by “bringing together staff members who have been involved in blockchain development, as well as domestic and overseas collaboration projects” to “expand” and “reorganize them into a blockchain development group.” The new group will reportedly become part of the Samsung Electronics wireless department.

China’s Blockchain Stocks Remain Unscathed Amid the Bitcoin Market Crash,https://btcmanager.com/chinas-blockchain-stocks-bitcoin-market-crash/,12 m-,"China’s blockchain-linked stocks remain undisrupted by the chaos surrounding the general cryptocurrency market. The eight Chinese A-share equities connected to the blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies are down less than 2% in Singapore on Thursday. In comparison, there was a more than 5% average plunge for a basket of 24 global crypto stocks outside China on the same day. The comparison is primarily due to Chinese past crypto trading crackdowns, such as the ban on fiat-cryptocurrencies transactions. There are, therefore, a cohort of mining companies and trading platforms while leading Chinese specialists in digital technology are supporting virtual currencies.That means that mainland crypto-connected shares are likely to be less affected by digital tokens, said Vijay Ayyar, Asia-Pacific leader with Luno crypto exchange in Singapore.One of the reasons for this looser partnership is that Chinese blockchain stocks have skipped the glaring path of global crypto in the context of more than one year of digital tokens.On Thursday, Bitcoin was steadier, trading about $40,000 in Hong Kong from 1:45 p.m. The mid-April record is around $25,000 short. The US exchange Coinbase Global Inc. dropped 5.9 percent to a record low on Wednesday, with MicroStrategy Inc. holding substantial Bitcoin dropping by almost 7 percent, among well-established, exposed crypto stocks. However, companies like MicroStrategy did well for long-term investment – over the past year, the stock has more than tripled.China’s cryptocurrency chilly stance dates back years. Alongside the nation’s failures to outlaw cryptos in their entirety, regulators announced in 2013 that bitcoin was not a real currency. They then referred to the danger of Bitcoin use for money laundering, the need to keep financial stability and protect yuan status as a fiat currency.Members of the public may keep cryptocurrencies or trade them, but they shut down significant exchanges in mainland China. In 2017, authorities banned initial coin offerings, allowing technology companies to collect money via the publication of crypto tokens.The growing crackdown may also be partly to improve the Chinese government-supported digital yuan initiative to enforcement authorities to keep money under tight supervision.Although the 2013 notice only named Bitcoin, some analysts took it to apply to any crypto given the currency disaster in Beijing. The Chinese Times of the state on Wednesday called the latest announcement a risk warning in nature. While it is not national legislation or regulations, it is to a certain degree an “industry practice,” the outlet quoted Zhu Youping, an official at the State Information Centre, as the policymaking think tank.It reveals, however, that China hasn’t quickly changed its crypto tack – which seemed sufficient to concern traders.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement

A Coinbase spokesperson said the company doesn’t comment on “rumors and speculation.”There’s no doubt that Coinbase has deep pockets following its April public listing and last week’s announcement of a $1.25 billion offering of convertible notes. The exchange has been on a steady acquisition trail in recent years, having purchased such crypto companies as prime broker Tagomi, infrastructure shop Bison Trails and data platform Skew. But asset management would be a new business for Coinbase, which has billions of dollars in institutional assets under custody. The Osprey deal hasn’t been finalized, both sources said.Osprey, which is known for its bitcoin fund, was in the news recently for launching a fund specializing in Polkadot, which is an alternative public blockchain to Ethereum. Coinbase is the custodian for Osprey’s DOT fund.Although small in comparison, Osprey Funds competes with Grayscale, whose assets are also under Coinbase’s custody. (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group.)“There’s clearly a desire for asset management from the perspective of Coinbase,” a second person who asked to remain anonymous said.Sign up for our newslettersBy signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policyThe leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

TRX and IOTA have also reclaimed horizontal support levels.IOTA has been moving downwards since April 16, when it reached a high of $2.74. The drop accelerated on May 19, leading to a low of $0.74 being reached the same day. However, the token has bounced considerably since then, currently trading at $1.30. 

The movement resembles a fourth wave pullback, since IOTA bounced right at the middle of a parallel channel connecting the upper and lower limits of waves one and two, respectively. In addition, it has now reclaimed the $1 area. If IOTA begins wave five, the two potential targets for the top would be found at $3.43 and $5.06, respectively.

"Fitness Guru Jillian Michaels Backs Cardano, Dogecoin",https://cryptobriefing.com/fitness-guru-jillian-michaels-backs-cardano-dogecoin/,9 m-,"Don't Miss Market Moving NewsCelebrity fitness trainer and TV personality Jillian Michaels revealed her cryptocurrency investment via Twitter today.Michaels mentioned that she holds $10,000 worth of DOGE and has staked $500,000 worth of ADA on the Cardano blockchain.I don’t hate doge – I threw 10k at it for fun. I threw 500k at Ada and staked it.— Jillian Michaels (@JillianMichaels) May 19, 2021She endorsed those cryptocurrencies in response to Shark Tank host Mark Cuban, who recently questioned the merits of Cardano and suggested the coin currently has limited commercial use. “Are you, personally, able to use ADA for anything?…That’s the question I ask about all crypto,” he recently stated on Twitter.Instead, Cuban has repeatedly expressed support for Dogecoin and has even added it to the Dallas Mavericks store as a means of payment. Michaels has criticized his stance, stating that choosing “DOGE over ADA is like choosing a porn star over Sophia Lauren.”Nevertheless, Michaels herself previously indicated limited support for Dogecoin. She mentioned a “sizable” Dogecoin investment at the end of April, but did not disclose the amount of that investment beyond the fact that it had doubled in value.I literally recently spent sizable amount of money on a crypto currency involving a dog in a meme – based off the advice of a 28 year old. And then… doubled by money. What is this life 🤯 #DogeDay— Jillian Michaels (@JillianMichaels) April 20, 2021Michaels is best known for her work on the reality TV series “The Biggest Loser” and various other series for NBC and CBS.Both Cardano and Dogecoin have quickly gained value. Cardano has gained 3,000% year-to-date, putting it among the top five coins. Dogecoin has gained 15,700% year-to-date, putting it at #7.Dogecoin has seen numerous endorsements from celebrities such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, KISS frontman Gene Simmons, and rapper Snoop Dogg. It has also found significant commercial adoption: there are currently about 1,300 merchants that accept the DOGE cryptocurrency, according to Cryptwerk.Meanwhile, Cardano has seen very little endorsement outside of the crypto industry. It is accepted at less than 200 stores, and Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson has insisted on reducing fees and ensuring security before ADA is widely used in payments.If other celebrities in addition to Jillian Michaels endorse Cardano, that could help Cardano maintain its position until it gains traction.Disclaimer: At the time of writing this author held less than $75 of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins.The information on or accessed through this website is obtained from independent sources we believe to be accurate and reliable, but Decentral Media, Inc. makes no representation or warranty as to the timeliness, completeness, or accuracy of any information on or accessed through this website.
